which posterity, to the remotest generation, can
never forget.</p>

<p>But a few weeks since, the steamer Northern
Indiana was burned on one of the Northern
lakes, and then and there it was, that this noble
and gallant deed was performed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">10</a></span>
You who have never seen a ship on fire can
form no idea of the awful horror of such a scene.
All was wild excitement and mad confusion.
The flames spread like a whirlwind over the
noble ship, and soon wrapt it in their withering
embrace. Every heart was lifted to God in
prayer; every voice was joined in supplication;
mothers were clasping their infants to their bosoms;
husbands endeavoring to save their wives;
fathers encircling their sons in their strong and
unfailing arms; the waters were a mass of living,
immortal beings, struggling for life.</p>

<p>Amid the hissing of the flames, the pale glare
of the atmosphere, and the wild shrieks of hopeless
agony that arose from the sinking passengers,
John McDonough might have been seen,
calm and composed, struggling nobly with the
swelling waves, and bearing in one hand <em>life-preservers</em>
to the perishing souls scattered over the
surface of the lake, which, to many, was destined
soon to be the winding-sheet of Death.</p>

<p>How noble the action! How my heart swells
within me when I think of the gallant and fearless
conduct of such a man!</p>

<p>When despair clothed every brow, fear paled
every cheek, and the wild cry&mdash;“Save, Lord, or
I perish”&mdash;echoed in the ears of the drowning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">11</a></span>
his lofty brow showed no signs of fear, his eye
beamed with hope. He still struggled on, and
on, till many and many a soul was rescued from
a watery grave.</p>

<p>I had rather be the brave, the dauntless, the
self-sacrificing John McDonough&mdash;the humble
laborer on the ill-fated Northern Indiana&mdash;than
Alexander the Great weeping because there were
no other worlds for him to conquer.</p>

<p>God bless thee, noble John McDonough!</p>

<p>Though no eulogy be pronounced at thy
death, no booming cannon thunder over thy
grave, no proud monument mark thy resting-place,
yet there will be erected in the hearts of
thy countrymen a monument more lasting than
marble, more enduring than brass. May thy
name live forever!</p>

<p>My young friends, do you not also see, concealed
as it were by the terrible grandeur and
painful horror of the scene, a beautiful and important
truth displayed in the conduct of this
noble-hearted man?</p>

<p>We are all embarked in a ship. The destination
of that ship is <em>Eternity</em>. The voyage is
tempestuous, and when we least expect it, the
fires of hell may take hold upon us. But, thanks
be to God, there is a Great Life-preserver always<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">12</a></span>
at hand. That Life-preserver I now extend to
you: reject it if you dare; destruction is the
consequence. Accept it; and you will soon be
landed on the blissful shores of Heaven. That
Life-preserver is</p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> church bells were sending forth their
merry chimes, and hundreds of children were
wending their way to the Sabbath-school. Mary
was late that morning, and ran very quickly to
her drawer, in which were kept her gloves, hymn-book,
catechism, &amp;c., and endeavored to jerk it
open at once; but in so doing she got it crooked,
and it would move neither way.</p>

<p>Being in a great hurry, she began at once to
fret and blame the drawer for not coming out.
She soon became quite angry; her check flushed,
her eyes sparkled, and with a violent effort she
pulled the drawer out, emptied its contents on<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">15</a></span>
the floor, tore her dress, disfigured her hymn-book,
and almost ruined the drawer itself.</p>

<p>Her father was patiently waiting in the hall
for his little daughter, when the accident occurred,
and asked her what was the matter. Her
instant reply was, “Nothing, Father; you go on&mdash;I
will overtake you presently.”</p>

<p>Little Mary did not overtake her father, and
he looked in vain for her at the Sabbath-school.</p>

<p>Her dress was so badly torn that she could
not go to Sabbath-school, and with tears flowing
down her cheeks, she sat down and thought soberly
over her conduct.</p>

<p>She doubtless felt very sorry for her anger, and
the unnecessary damage she had done.</p>

<p>No one, when the family returned from church,
said a word to her, but left her to her own reflections.
When her father had taken off his hat
and seated himself, she modestly approached him,
threw her arms around his neck, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Father, do you know why your little Mary
was absent from Sabbath-school this morning?”</p>

<p>“No, my child,” he replied.</p>

<p>“I was in a very great hurry, and attempted
to pull my drawer out very quickly, and got it
fastened so tightly that it would move neither
one way nor the other. I tried and tried, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">16</a></span>
would not move. I then got angry with the
drawer, pulled it very hard, and not only scattered
its contents over the floor, but hung the knob
in my dress and tore it so badly that I could not
come to the Sabbath-school.”</p>

<p>Her father told her he willingly forgave her,
and that she must also ask God’s forgiveness, for
she had committed a sin in giving way to her
anger. He also told her to remember that nothing
was ever made by getting angry. If she
ever tried to do anything, and could not do it at
once, she must not get angry, but be patient and
calm.</p>

<p>I hope this little thing taught Mary an important
lesson&mdash;and may it teach you the same, dear
little reader. <em>Nothing was ever made by getting
angry, but something always lost.</em></p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">There</span> was once a great storm on the Sea of
Galilee.</p>

<p>The wild winds howled, and the furious waves
rose almost mountain high.</p>

<p>There was a small vessel in the midst of this
storm, and in this vessel were some of Christ’s
disciples.</p>

<p>When the storm had reached its utmost fury,
and certain destruction seemed to await those
who were in it, a man was seen walking on the
water towards the vessel.</p>

<p>The disciples were at once struck with wonder
and amazement. They were doubtless somewhat
superstitious, and supposed it to be a spirit;
for they were well aware that nothing having
flesh and blood like themselves could walk on the
surface of the water without sinking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19">19</a></span>
But whose familiar voice is that, heard even
above the roar of the sea, and the noise of the
winds? Who is He that dares approach their
vessel on such a night?</p>

<p>The voice is the voice of their Saviour; and
He who dreads not the rage of the billows, is He
whom “the winds and the sea obey.” What are
His words? They are few and well chosen&mdash;such
as were best suited to the occasion: “It is
I; be not afraid!” Oh, how welcome the visitor!
How delightful that familiar voice! How
the downcast hearts of the disciples throb with
joy when they welcome their Saviour to their
bosoms! How their hearts gush forth in thanks
when they see the raging billows become, at His
command, as gentle as a lamb, and the furious
winds as innocent as a little child.</p>

<p>Children, do not we gather some important
truths from this Scripture narrative? In the
storms of adversity and sadness, affliction and
bereavement, ought we not hear Christ saying to
us, “It is I; be not afraid?”</p>

shield, and a mother’s heart to love. The sun
shines but dimly on the head of the orphan, for

power can release from its embrace. When a
father dies, and she who ‘loves with a deep,
strong, fervent love,’ is laid in the grave, then is
the brightness of earthly existence extinguished.”</p>

<p>Children, how accurately do the above lines
describe the lonely and forsaken condition of the
orphan!</p>

<p>Have you never felt your little hearts throb
with sorrow when you saw the children of the
Orphan Asylum walk quietly down the aisle of
the church and seat themselves in regular order
in the front pews? Did not their plain dress
speak to you in language which you were obliged<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">23</a></span>
to hear? Did not the prayer arise from your
breasts, that God would be a Father to the fatherless,
that He would watch over, guide and protect,
throughout the journey of life, that helpless
little band of fatherless and motherless children?</p>

<p>How lonely must their condition be. No father
to counsel, no mother to love, no home
beneath whose shelter they may rest, but <a name="dependent" id="dependent"></a><ins title="Original has dependant">dependent</ins>
upon the cold charities of a colder world.</p>

<p>He who would treat unkindly, or wound the
feelings of <em>an orphan</em>, is worse than the brute of
the field.</p>

<p>My young orphan friends, there is but one
source to which I can direct you; there is but
one friend who will never desert you; there is
but one house whose door will never be closed
against you.</p>

<p>That source is God; that friend is Christ;
that house is one not made with hands, eternal
in the heavens. God will counsel you; upon
the bosom of Christ you may “lean for repose;”
and the angels of heaven will ever welcome you
to their blest abode.</p>

<p>The kind father and the loving mother, from
whom you have been separated by death, you
shall meet again, if you are Christians.</p>

<p>And to you, dear little readers, who know not<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">24</a></span>

word he uttered. “I should be very careful,”

how guarded your conduct, how pure your every

Yes, there is. Christ has <em>died</em>, that you might

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Early</span> one morning, in the month of September,
184&ndash;, Mr. Ward’s family were assembled
around the family altar for prayer, to implore
the blessing and protection of our Heavenly
Father in behalf of their only boy, who was
about leaving his home for a distant school.</p>

<p>Thomas, a boy of about twelve summers, was
deeply affected by the solemn services, and as he
arose from his knees his eyes were filled with
tears, thinking, perhaps, that he might never be
permitted to enjoy that delightful privilege again.
His father prayed particularly that God would
take care of his boy during his absence from his
parents; that He would preserve him from all
dangers; that He would be near him in all his
temptations; and, if they should not meet again<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">30</a></span>
on earth, that they might all&mdash;father, mother and
son&mdash;meet where the “wicked cease from troubling,
and the weary are at rest.” He endeavored
to impress upon his mind the necessity of
prayer, and that he should never neglect it, under
any circumstances. <em>Don’t be ashamed to pray,
my son</em>, said his father.</p>

<p>The ringing of the car-bell announced that in
a short time he must be off. The most trying
point had now come,&mdash;he must bid his parents
farewell. Clasping his arms around his mother’s
neck, he said: “Oh, my Mother, my Mother, shall
I ever see you again?” and with a kiss to each,
bade his affectionate parents adieu, and, valise
in hand, walked hastily to the dépôt.</p>

<p>Having procured his ticket, he seated <a name="himself" id="himself"></a><ins title="Original has him self">himself</ins>
in the cars, and in a few moments left the
home of his childhood for the P&mdash;&mdash; H&mdash;&mdash;
school, at B&mdash;&mdash;.  His heart was sad, as he
thought of the many happy hours he had spent
“at home” with his kind parents, and a tear
stole silently down his cheek. These sad and
melancholy thoughts, however, were soon banished
from his mind by the magnificent scenery
of the country through which he was passing.</p>

<p>He thought “the country,” as it was called in
town, was the loveliest place he had ever seen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31">31</a></span>
Thomas’ mind became so much engaged with the
picturesque scenery&mdash;mountains, lakes and valleys&mdash;that
he reached his place of destination
ere he supposed he had travelled half-way.</p>

<p>He met the principal at the dépôt, awaiting
his arrival, and in a few moments they were on
their way to the school. Nothing of interest occurred
during the remainder of the day, with the
exception of the boys’ laughing at Thomas, calling
him “town boy,” etc.; “initiating” him, as
they termed it. When the time for retiring to
rest drew near, and one after another of the boys
fell asleep, Thomas was surprised that not one of
them offered a petition to God, asking Him to
take care of them during the silent watches of
the night. He knelt beside his bed, and attempted
to offer a short prayer; but his companions
were laughing and singing, and he arose
from his knees, wishing that he was at home,
where he could, in his quiet little chamber, offer
up his evening devotions. Some of the boys were
actually so rude as to call him “Parson Ward,”
and ask him if he intended holding forth next
Sabbath?</p>

<p>The next night Thomas felt so <em>ashamed</em>, that
he determined <em>not to pray</em>, and laid his head on
a prayerless pillow,&mdash;a thing he had not done<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">32</a></span>
since he was able to say, “Gentle Jesus, meek
and mild.” The last words of his father, “<em>Don’t
be ashamed to pray</em>” came to his mind; but
thinking about them as little as possible, he soon
fell asleep.</p>

<p>In a short time Thomas became the ringleader
of the gang in all that was bad, and soon learned
to curse and swear worse than any of his companions.</p>

<p>On a beautiful Sabbath morning, instead of
going to church, he wandered off, and finding
nothing to engage his thoughts, determined to
take a bath. He had scarcely been in the water
five minutes, when he was seized with cramp, and
sunk to rise no more. The last words that
lingered on the lips of the drowning boy were,
“Oh, my mother!”</p>

<p>The awful death of Thomas speaks for itself.
May it serve as a warning to those who violate
God’s holy commandment, and are <em>ashamed</em> to
<em>pray</em>. May it also teach us how quickly one sin
leads to another. His <em>first</em> sin was neglecting
to pray; his <em>second</em>, profanity; his <em>third</em>, Sabbath-breaking,
which terminated in his death.</p>

<h2><a name="the_rose" id="the_rose"></a>THE ROSE.</h2>

<p class="center">“There is no rose without a thorn.”</p>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">There</span> are few lovelier things than the rose to
be met with along the pathway of life.</p>

<p>There is something about it so meek and modest,
that I love to look at it; and what is sweeter
than the mellow fragrance of a beautiful rose?
It always reminds me of that beautiful country
where, we are told, never-fading flowers continue
to bloom forever.</p>

<p>The Church of Christ is compared, in the
Bible, to the Rose of Sharon; and it seems to
me that the inspired penman could not have
found, throughout the length and breadth of the
world, anything better suited to convey the idea
of gentle lowliness and meek humility, than the
rose.</p>

<p>Its fragrance can be enjoyed by all. It is not
sweeter to the king than to the peasant. So with
religion. It is a fountain from which all can
drink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_35" id="page_35">35</a></span>
There is another thing about the rose which
should teach us a lesson. As there is no rose
without a thorn, so there is no enjoyment without
some pain connected with it. There are
many children who are always discontented;
they are never pleased with any thing, but are
always looking out for what is disagreeable, and
not for what is pleasant. What is this, but forgetting
the delightful fragrance of the rose, and
piercing our fingers with the few thorns which
are about it. Our blessings are much more
numerous than our cares and troubles. Why
not, then, clip off the thorns, and keep merely the
fully opened rose?</p>

<p>As the leaves of the rose wither and die, so
must we.</p>

<p>Let us always remember this, and also live in
such a way, by shedding a sweet fragrance about
our pathway, that all who know us will love us,
and forget the few thorns of evil which may be
found in our characters.</p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> sun had disappeared behind the western
hills, and darkness was fast covering the face of
nature, when a little girl, who had been to a distant
city, commenced retracing her steps homeward.
A kind friend handed her a lantern, and
told her if she followed the road on which the
lantern shone, it would certainly direct her home.
She started with a light heart and joyous spirits,
much delighted with her journey beside the still
waters, and through the green pastures.</p>

<p>By and by she came to a certain place where
two roads branched off. She did not know
which one to take; but soon found that her
lantern shone very plainly on the one beset with
thorns and briers. She concluded to disregard<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39" id="page_39">39</a></span>
the advice of her friend, and took the opposite
road, as it seemed so much more pleasant than
the one on which her lantern shone. At first
her pathway was bordered with roses of the
sweetest fragrance, and with <a name="everything" id="everything"></a><ins title="Original has everthing">everything</ins> calculated
to make a young person happy. Finally she
reached a point in her journey where she knew
not what to do. She had no lamp to direct her;
no kind friend to whom she might look for directions;
all around her was dark and dismal.
Wherever she trod, her steps seemed beset with
troubles of every kind.</p>

<p>At last a friendly voice whispered in her ear,
and said: “Stop, my dear child&mdash;stop and think.
You know not whither you are going. You are
in the road to death. Stop, before you further
go.”</p>

<p>She determined to turn her course, and retraced
her steps with a heavy heart, determined
thereafter always to follow the road on which
her lantern shone. She soon reached the place
where she had left her lantern, and found its rays
still brightly shining on the same road.</p>

<p>She continued her journey onward, and found,
though it was rough at first, the farther she proceeded,
the better was she pleased. When she
reached her home, she found her friends anxiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40">40</a></span>
awaiting her arrival. They all greeted her
with a kiss, and welcomed her back again.</p>

<p>Children, the little girl about whom I have
been telling you is the young Christian, commencing
her journey from the city of Destruction
to the New Jerusalem. The journey is her
Christian life; the two roads are the long and
narrow road to Heaven, and the broad road to
Hell; the kind friend is some fellow Christian,
and the lantern is God’s Holy Word. The thorns
in the one road are the trials of a Christian;
while the roses in the other are the allurements
placed there by the Wicked One, to ensnare the
careless and inconsiderate. Her <em>home</em> is <em>Heaven</em>.</p>

<p>Young Christian, learn a lesson from the conduct
of this little girl: Never pursue the course
which seems most pleasant, but the one laid down
in the Bible.</p>

the water had nearly reached its highest point,
a lumberman was seen in the midst of the
stream, attempting to secure a lot of timber
which had broken loose from its fastening.</p>

<p>In his deep interest to secure the timber, he
went too far out into the current. His little
bark was caught by the rapid tide, and borne
along with almost lightning rapidity.</p>

<p>There he sat, motionless as a pillar, not knowing
at what moment he should be swallowed up
by the roaring and foaming stream. A friend
on shore sees his critical situation, mounts his
horse, and rides, courier-like, to a neighboring
bridge which spans the river. On and on he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_44" id="page_44">44</a></span>
speeds; now the rider and the boat are side by
side; anon the boat passes him, but he spurs his
noble animal onward, reaches the bridge in time,
seizes a rope and throws it over the arch, awaiting
with breathless suspense the approach of the
pale and fear-stricken lumberman.</p>

<p>The boat passes immediately under the arch,
the boatman grasps the rope with death-like
earnestness, and is <em>saved</em>.</p>

<p>One moment’s delay of the rider, or his failure
to grasp the rope, would have sealed his doom
forever, and the noble H&mdash;&mdash; been his grave.</p>

<p>My dear young friends, how often do we see
persons, in their mad attempts to procure the
filthy lucre of this world, go too far into the current
of Sin, and are swept wildly over the cataract
of Destruction, not knowing, or not desiring
to see, that the rope of Salvation is within their
grasp! Children, Christ bids you come, <em>now</em>.
If you delay another moment, your destiny for
despair may be sealed.</p>

<p>How bitter will the thought be, when you
come to die,&mdash;“I might have been saved, but I
neglected the golden offering of mercy, and
therefore must be consigned to a never-ending
eternity of misery and suffering!”</p>

the habit of sleeping late in the morning, purchased
a small alarm watch, hoping that it would
be the means of breaking her of a practice not

a sinful waste of time. At night, on retiring to
rest, she so adjusted the watch that it would
awaken her at five o’clock the next morning.
The watch, with a punctuality worthy to be imitated

thought it was not worth while to get up then,
but would lie in bed only fifteen minutes longer.
The expiration of the fifteen minutes found her
sleeping soundly, and she did not awake till the
sun had risen far above the tree-tops, and the
laborers were busy at their work.</p>

<p>The next morning she heard her watch at its
accustomed noise, but came to the conclusion
that getting up ahead of the sun was all a
humbug.</p>

<p>The next morning she slept so soundly that
she scarcely heard the watch at all; and that
night concluded not to wind it up, as she had no
idea of having her morning’s nap disturbed by
such a disagreeable noise as that. Thus did she
return to her former bad habit, and “her last
state was worse than the first.”</p>

<p>Each of you, my dear young friends, has an
alarm watch in your breast. The moment you<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">48</a></span>
disobey your parents, utter an untruth, use a
profane expression, or break God’s Holy Day,
you hear the busy fluttering of that watch whispering
in your ear, “<em>you have done wrong</em>, <span class="p70">YOU
HAVE DONE WRONG</span>.” The first time you did wrong
how loudly did that little watch whir and buzz!
You turned pale, and your heart throbbed so
violently that you could almost hear it.</p>

<p>The next time its noise was fainter and fainter;
and at last it grew so feeble that you could not
hear it all.</p>

<p>Then it was that you could swear so boldly,
utter an untruth without your cheek coloring,
and break the Sabbath without one painful
thought.</p>

<p>My young reader, you know too well what that
alarm watch is, whose ticking you so frequently
hear in your breast. It is your <span class="smcap">Conscience</span>.
And oh, how I tremble when I think of what an
awful thing it is to endeavor to drown the voice
of that conscience!</p>

<p>Day after day, since your early infancy, your
conscience has been begging, entreating you to
come to Christ and be saved. Its voice has been
unheeded. Beware, O young man or young
woman, how you trifle with your conscience! Its
voice, once stifled, will be hushed forever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49">49</a></span>
Like the young lady about whom I have been
telling you, if you do not obey its summons at
once, but keep on putting it off and off, it will
leave you in the awful embrace of that sleep
“which knows no waking” in this world, and
you will only be aroused by the piercing notes
of the Archangel’s trump,&mdash;“Come to judgment.”</p>

<p>Conscience, my young friends, is “the fire that
is not quenched,” and “the worm that dieth not,”
which shall continue to burn, yet not consume,
to gnaw and not diminish your immortal soul, if
you do not obey its whisperings by coming to
your Saviour, now, in the morning of life.</p>

<p>How awful! oh, how awful will it be, to hear
the voice of your disregarded conscience ringing
throughout the dark, deep caverns of hell:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Because I have called, and ye refused; I
have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded:
I also will laugh at your calamity; I
will mock when your fear cometh; when <em>your
fear cometh as a desolation</em>, and your <em>destruction
cometh as a whirlwind</em>; when distress and anguish
cometh upon you.”</p>

<h2><a name="i_want_to_be_a_minister" id="i_want_to_be_a_minister"></a>“I WANT TO BE A MINISTER.”</h2>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

  <div class="line"><span class="smcap">Lives</span> of great men all remind us</div>
  <div class="line indent1">We can make our lives sublime;</div>

</div></div></div>

<div class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Longfellow.</span></div>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">More</span> than a century ago there lived in England
an orphan boy of no ordinary promise.
From his early childhood, “I want to be a minister,”
was his chief desire. Being deprived not
only of the counsel of a father and the affection
of a mother, but also of the necessary amount
of money to carry out his cherished desire, his
youthful spirit was bowed to the earth, and his
noble heart throbbed only with feelings of bitter
disappointment and despair.</p>

<p>But a brighter day dawns. There is a prospect
for his ardent desire to be gratified. A
wealthy lady kindly volunteers to pay all of his
expenses at the University of Oxford, if he will
become a minister of the Church of England.</p>

<p>But he is a Dissenter, and his noble spirit refuses
to sell the religion of his father and mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_56" id="page_56">56</a></span>
for the perishable riches of this world, and
he most respectfully declines the proffered kindness.
God bless thee, noble youth! Wait patiently&mdash;don’t
despair&mdash;<em>never give up</em>. “Where
there’s a will, there’s a way.” The path of Duty
is always the path of Right.</p>

<p>Not long after this occurrence, a poor boy,
dressed in the garb of poverty, presented himself
at the door of a celebrated minister, and
asked to have a private interview with him relative
to studying for the ministry. The minister
listened patiently to the recital of his many difficulties
and numerous trials, but told him that
he thought it entirely unheard of, for a youth
like himself to think about entering upon so high
and responsible a calling. He advised him to
think no more of preaching, but to choose some
other calling.</p>

<p>Disheartened at himself, discouraged by his
friends, poor, penniless and forsaken, he knew
not whither to go. No smile of encouragement
met his eye; no voice of approval sanctioned
his noble endeavor. There was one Friend, however,
who had never forsaken him; who had never
turned a deaf ear even to his smallest desire;
who had ever loved him with fatherly affection
and motherly tenderness. To that friend he then<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57" id="page_57">57</a></span>
betook himself, and when engaged in fervent
prayer, a postman knocked at the door, and handed
him a letter from an old friend of his father,
informing him of his willingness to take him under
his care and assist him in his studies, if he
was still intent upon studying for the ministry.
“This,” he exclaimed, “I look upon almost as an
answer from Heaven, and while I live I shall always
adore so seasonable an opening of divine
Providence.”</p>

<p>The wishes of the poor orphan boy were thus
gratified; and before many years had passed
away, under the guidance and instruction of his
friend, he became a bright and shining light on
the walls of Zion.</p>

<p>Youthful reader, this orphan boy was <span class="smcap">Philip
Doddridge</span>&mdash;the pious and devoted minister of
Christ, the beautiful writer, the faithful pastor,
the brilliant Christian.</p>

<p>If there be any one into whose hands this little
article may fall, who, like Doddridge, “wants
to be a minister,” and is prevented from accomplishing
his desire on account of want of means,
let me say one word&mdash;<em>never despair!</em> If God
wants you to be a minister, He will provide the
means. Wait patiently, and pray earnestly.</p>

<p class="p90">Children, obey your parents in all things; for this is well-pleasing
unto the Lord.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bible.</span></p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">On</span> an evening in July, 18&ndash;, as several youths,
from twelve to eighteen years of age, were standing
at the corner of a street in the little village
of B&mdash;&mdash;, Rufus Taylor, one of their companions,
came up to them and said, “Come, boys,
let’s go and take a cool bath&mdash;’tis terribly
warm.”</p>

<p>Rufus had been positively forbidden by his parents
to go bathing without their consent; but,
thinking they would never know anything about
it, he came up to the group of boys and made the
preceding proposition.</p>

<p>They all, with one consent, agreed to it, and
soon were on their way to the bay.</p>

<p>Arriving at their famous bathing spot, and undressing
in a few moments, they soon plunged into
the cooling water, and swam to an island, a
few hundred yards distant.</p>

<p>Rufus alone remained on the shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61">61</a></span>
He was afraid to attempt swimming such a
long distance, as he had but recently learned to
swim. But, collecting all his courage, he followed
his comrades, and cried out that he would
overtake them or be <em>damned!</em> What an awful
word to proceed from the lips of a boy twelve
years old! He had not swum more than fifty
yards, when his strength failed, and he sank beneath
the blue waves of the roaring ocean. Every
effort was made by his friends to save him,
but they were all in vain.</p>

<p>Let his untimely end be a solemn warning to
boys who are in the habit of disobeying their
parents.</p>

<p>May it teach a lesson, also, to those who indulge
in the use of profane language. Rufus did
not think that his <em>damnation</em> was so near at hand,
when he uttered that awful curse.</p>

<p>He was hurried into the presence of his Maker
without one moment’s warning, and with the
profane expression still lingering on his lips.</p>

<p>Who can tell the unutterable anguish of his
parents when the intelligence of the death of
their only son&mdash;their disobedient boy&mdash;reached
their ears? His father, on being told that his
son was drowned, exclaimed, “<em>Oh, my disobedient
son! I told him not to go bathing without my consent.
Would to God I had died for him!</em>”</p>

<p class="noi">“<span class="smcap">What</span> can be meant by ‘the little gambler?’
I never heard of a boy’s gambling in my life!”
my little reader will, no doubt, exclaim. Though
it may seem very strange, yet such things often
occur. I will relate to you an incident that occurred
in my school-boy days, which, perhaps,
may bring to your recollection the fact that you
have indulged in it yourself. Boys as well as
men are frequently found to be gamblers, though,
of course, on a much smaller scale.</p>

<p>At the corner of a street in the city of &mdash;&mdash;
was a gaming house, kept by a boy not more
than twelve years old. It was one of the most
beautiful and pleasant places I ever saw, well
calculated to entice within its polluted walls the
heedless and inconsiderate youth. Here, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_64" id="page_64">64</a></span>
school hours, quite a number of boys were accustomed
to assemble and spend their evenings.</p>

<p>Passing near the above place one pleasant
evening in May, I saw a youth, whom I shall call
James Jones, who seemed to be intently engaged
in the issue of a game. He was successful; and
when he gathered up the “stakes,” a smile of exulting
joy passed over his face. I saw nothing
more of James till some eight years after the
above occurrence. I was standing in the court-room
one morning, when I heard the clerk read
out a charge against James Jones for forcibly
breaking into the trunk of a certain gentleman,
and stealing therefrom the sum of $500.</p>

<p>On examining the appearance of the young
man more closely, I found him to be the same
youth whom I had seen in the “little gambling
house.” A widowed mother sat by his side, weeping
most bitterly. His appearance had altered
very much. Long confinement had turned the
healthy, robust man into a mere skeleton. His
countenance was haggard, his cheek sunken, his
eye dim, his step tremulous.</p>

<p>He was found guilty, and sentenced to five
years’ imprisonment in the State Penitentiary.
When he arose to receive the sentence the most
perfect indifference was manifested by him, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65" id="page_65">65</a></span>
his poor mother seemed as though she would die
beneath the weight of such heavy affliction.</p>

<p>She informed me that James, at a very early
age, became fond of bad company, and would often
steal away at night, and spend the time allotted
to rest in the most dissipated assemblies.
He finally became involved in debt, and determined
to get out at all hazards. He was thus
almost forced to commit a deed which brought
the grey hairs of his mother in sorrow to the
grave, and ruined him for life.</p>

<p>Doubtless, you would like to know what was
James’ first act in his downward career. It was
betting at the “<em>little gambling house</em>.” There he
learned to do evil rather than good.</p>

<p>I have neglected to explain to you what the
<em>gambling house</em> was. It was a wide-spreading
elm tree, beneath the hospitable shade of which
the boys of the neighborhood were accustomed to
meet and play marbles for <em>have-ance</em>; that is,
each boy kept all the marbles he knocked out of
the ring.</p>

<p>Have any of you ever been guilty of this? If
so, then you were gambling, and, unless you stop
it at once, the gallows or the penitentiary may be
your end. Do not gamble with marbles; it may
be your ruin. Truly, “The way of the transgressor

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Gertrude Mason</span> was a sweet little girl of
about ten summers, with rosy cheeks, and bright,
sunny hair.</p>

<p>She did not live in the city, like a great many
children, but she lived at a quiet little cottage
in the country, which she called “Rose Neath.”</p>

<p>Gertrude was a good child.</p>

<p>She loved everybody, and everybody seemed
to love her.</p>

<p>She was meek and gentle, and was always willing
to do any thing she could to minister to the
wants of the poor and needy.</p>

<p>Gertrude had a beautiful Newfoundland dog,
named Rescue, and wherever she went, her friend
Rescue was always at her side. She loved him
very much, and used to give him part of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_69" id="page_69">69</a></span>
meals every day. One lovely Sabbath morning,
when the sun was shining brightly, and the little
birds singing sweetly from the boughs of the
trees, Gertrude, dressed neatly and tidily, hymn-book
and catechism in hand, started off for the
Sabbath-school.</p>

<p>She had not gone very far, when she came to
a creek.</p>

<p>Thrown across this creek was a log, on which
persons were in the habit of crossing.</p>

<p>It had rained the night before, and the log was
very slippery. Gertrude did not think of this,
and was about crossing over, when her foot
slipped, and she was thrown headlong into the
swollen current.</p>

<p>She would have been drowned, had it not been
for her faithful friend Rescue, who swam in and
brought her safely to the shore.</p>

<p>Thus was the life of this lovely girl saved by
her affectionate dog.</p>

<p>This little story should teach us two lessons.</p>

<p><em>First</em>, if we wish persons to love us, we must
be kind and attentive to them.</p>

<p><em>Secondly</em>, the pathway of life is very slippery,
and many of our companions fall into very great
sins, and it is our duty, like Rescue, to save them
from destruction.</p>

<div class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Longfellow.</span></div>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Beneath</span> the scorching rays of a blistering summer’s
sun, or chilled by the piercing blast of winter,
a puny, sickly youth might have been seen
daily ascending a ladder, bearing on his head a
heavy weight of slate. There is nothing about
his appearance but his feeble step and emaciated
frame, calculated to attract the attention of the
passer-by: a closer observation, however, will
show that he possesses an eye which bespeaks an
amount of patient perseverance but seldom
known.</p>

<p>On one occasion, when about twelve years of
age, while engaged in his accustomed labor, his
foot misses the round of the ladder which he had
so long ascended, and the infirm youth is thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_72" id="page_72">72</a></span>
a distance of thirty-five feet on the hard stone
pavement beneath. In a state of perfect insensibility
he is taken up and borne to the arms of his
afflicted friends. For two long weeks he remains
in a state of unconsciousness, not knowing
the nearest and dearest of his relatives.</p>

<p>At the expiration of this time his mind begins
to revive, and his feeble eye wanders about the
room with listless indifference. Recovering from
his attack, he immediately inquires for a book in
which he had been deeply interested previous to
the accident which came so near terminating his
earthly career.</p>

<p>No one seems to answer his inquiries. “Why
do you not speak? <em>Pray let me have my book!</em>”
Still no one replies. At last some one takes a
slate and writes upon it that the book had been
returned to its owner.</p>

<p>“Why do you <em>write</em> to me?” exclaimed the sufferer&mdash;“speak,
<em>speak</em>! <span class="p70">SPEAK</span>!” Again was the
pencil taken and the three words&mdash;<em>you are deaf</em>&mdash;written.</p>

<p>How severe the affliction! No more can that
ear drink in the sweet melody of the little warblers;
no more listen to those words of affection
which make home the brightest and happiest spot
in the world; no more hear the gentle notes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_73" id="page_73">73</a></span>
the “sweet singer of Israel,” or gather the soul-stirring
anthems that echo and reëcho through
the vaulted roof of God’s sanctuary.</p>

<p>As his father was very poor, he was placed in
an almshouse to keep him from starvation.</p>

<p>He was soon removed, however, from his lonely
prison home, and placed under a shoemaker,
but was treated so unkindly that his friends
found it necessary to have him again put in the
poorhouse.</p>

<p>His studious habits and intellectual qualities
soon attracted the notice of the officers of the
almshouse, and he was treated with marked
kindness and attention. While others were
wasting the golden moments of youth, the <em>deaf
shoemaker</em> was busy garnering his spare minutes,
and storing his mind with information which
was destined to exert an influence throughout
the world.</p>

<p>In a short time he was removed to the London
Missionary Society, whence he went to Malta as
a printer.</p>

<p>Here he studied very closely, and, after returning
to London, accompanied Mr. Groves in a
tour through Russia, Georgia, Armenia, Kurdistan
and Persia.</p>

<p>During this tour he gathered a vast amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_74" id="page_74">74</a></span>
information relative to Eastern manners and customs,
which rendered him one of the most instructive
and interesting writers in the world.</p>

<p>He published, as the fruit of his arduous toil
during this journey, quite a number of books,
which have been greatly sought after both in
Europe and America, and have made him a welcome
guest at thousands of happy firesides.</p>

<p>His toilsome and unceasing labors for the cause
of truth and religion were too severe for so
feeble a frame, and at an early age, not fifty
years old, <span class="smcap">John Kitto</span>&mdash;the deaf shoemaker of
Plymouth&mdash;gently fell asleep in the arms of his
Saviour&mdash;beloved and respected by all who
knew him, and honored by those who had become
familiar with him from his deeply interesting
and invaluable productions.</p>

<p>In speaking of Kitto, a clergyman of considerable
distinction uses the following beautiful
language:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Rarely have we read a more touching record
of heroic struggle than the toilsome ascent of
the deaf boy of Plymouth to the lofty position
of the world-famed Editor of the Biblical Encyclopædia,
the Pictorial Bible, the Daily Bible Illustrations.
He reached, through incredible difficulties,
a position that few attain under the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_75" id="page_75">75</a></span>
favorable circumstances, and has left behind him
nearly fifty volumes, some of which take high
rank as works of critical authority. Truly the
heroic ages have not yet ceased, and there is a
heroism of the solitary student that is a nobler
thing than that of the warrior on the field of
battle; and such heroism is seen in the life of
Kitto.”</p>

<p>My young friends, how touchingly beautiful
and highly instructive is the brief but brilliant
life of John Kitto! Do not</p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Norman Hall</span> was what most of us would call
a “dull boy;” that is, though he studied hard,
yet he was never ahead in his classes, and could
not master his lessons as easily as a great many
other boys. He was respected and beloved not
only by his teacher, but also by the scholars.
His father and mother both felt very sad because
their only boy did not rank among the first in
his class, and knew not how to account for it.</p>

<p>One Friday, Norman missed nearly all of his
lessons, and was so much discouraged that he almost
determined to quit studying entirely and go
to some honest trade. He left the school-room
with tears in his eyes, thinking that he had entered
it for the last time. As he was going home,
he saw a large and deep hole in a rock, which a
small stream, by continually falling in the same
place, had worn. It was the very thing he needed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_78" id="page_78">78</a></span>
and suited him exactly. The thought at once
arose in his mind, if a little stream, so soft in itself,
can make such a deep and lasting impression
on this hard and flinty rock, I am sure, by hard
studying and close application, I can make an
impression on my mind, which certainly is not as
hard as this rock.</p>

<p>He returned to school on Monday, and studied
more diligently than he had ever done before; and
as he grew in years, he grew in understanding,
and at length became a learned man.</p>

<p>Remember, “That a drop hollows out the stone
not by force, but by falling often; so you will
become learned, not by a violent effort, but by
frequent reading.”</p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> sun was hanging low in the West; dark
and threatening banks of lead-colored clouds
were moving slowly across the heavens; the distant
muttering of thunder, and quick and piercing
flashes of lightning, bade me prepare for the approaching
storm. In circumstances like these, I
was riding slowly along the banks of a canal,
when my attention was attracted by the appearance
of a small house, which sat just above my
head, on a little eminence. Seeing the storm was
rapidly approaching, I thought it would be a
good shelter from the rain.</p>

<p>The unhinged shutters, the broken panes of
glass whose places were supplied by dirty rags,
the large cracks between the logs, all told too
plainly that withering poverty had there an
abode. After repeated knocks at the door, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_81" id="page_81">81</a></span>
woman made her appearance. Such a human
being I had never seen. She looked more like
a fiend from the regions of the damned, than
a living and immortal soul. Her cheek was
sunken; her eye dim and staring wildly about;
her hair thrown loosely over her shoulders; her
feet uncovered; and her person clad in the most
filthy and disgusting manner.</p>

<p>She did not seem accustomed to seeing strange
faces, and gave me such a wild stare that my very
blood chilled in my veins. There we both stood.
For some moments not a word was uttered by
either. I was waiting to see if she would ask
me to take a seat. This she did not do; and
feeling that I had a matter of more importance
than politeness to attend to&mdash;<em>her soul’s welfare</em>&mdash;I
sat down on the remains of what was once a
chair, and commenced the following conversation:</p>

<p>“Are you a Christian?” “No.” “Do you
ever expect or hope to be a <em>Christian</em>?” “No.”
“Have you ever felt the workings of God’s Spirit
upon your heart?” “Never, since a child.”
“Have you at any period in your past life ever
read your Bible?” “Yes, I read it when a
school-girl.” “Did you not see a peculiar beauty
and simplicity in it?” “I did not.” “Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_82" id="page_82">82</a></span>
believe in the Bible?” “Yes,” she angrily
replied, “<em>I believe it to be a lie from beginning to
end</em>.” “Have you ever read any other books besides
the Bible?” “I have read Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s
Progress, and believe that he was as complete
a liar as ever lived, and never experienced
one feeling described in that book, but wrote it
only to deceive the foolish common people.”
“Are you, in your present situation, willing to
die?” “<em>Yes, and willing to go to hell, and stay
there forever and ever!</em>”</p>

<p>Giving her several tracts on infidelity, which
she contemptuously threw on the floor, I invoked
a Father’s blessing on her, and departed&mdash;never
to meet again till we stand around the judgment-seat
of Christ.</p>

<p>The clouds which were wandering over the
heavens when I entered the house, had collected
in a mass, and produced one of the most awful
storms I ever witnessed in my life. The wind
blew most furiously; the rain poured in torrents;
peal after peal of the most deafening thunder
echoed and reëchoed among the mountain crags;
and flash after flash of piercing lightning darted
across the heavens. But, my dear young friends,
this storm did not compare, in its madness and
fury, with that still more awful storm of despair<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_83" id="page_83">83</a></span>
and hopeless agony which was raging in the breast
of her from whom I had just parted.</p>

<p>Dear young friends, do not put off till to-morrow
the eternal interests of your immortal souls.
Remember&mdash;oh, remember the terrible condition
of the woman about whom I have been telling
you.</p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">A mother</span> with three children was once returning
home, at a late hour of the night, through
one of those dark and lonely passes which abound
in the Alps mountains.</p>

<p>The night was so very cold that she drew two
of her children close to her side, and clasped the
youngest to her breast, in order to keep them
from freezing.</p>

<p>They thus journeyed on, drawn rapidly over
the smoothly beaten road by their faithful horse,
dreaming only of the warm fire and affectionate
welcome which awaited them at their mountain
home, little thinking of the danger which lurked
so short a distance behind them.</p>

<p>Presently she heard in the far-off distance the
faint howl of a wolf.</p>

<p>In a few seconds that of another, and another,
fell upon her ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_86" id="page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>The sound grew louder and louder, and the
number seemed to increase every moment.</p>

<p>The thought at once flashed across her mind,
that a pack of half-starved wolves was in hot
pursuit of herself and darling little ones.</p>

<p>The noble horse knew too well the danger that
awaited himself and his precious burden, and
with renewed speed hastened rapidly onward.</p>

<p>But his strength was not sufficient to rescue his
mistress and her little ones from the jaws of
twenty hungry wolves; for their fearful yell
rang louder and louder on the midnight air, till,
on looking behind her, the affrighted mother beheld
them within a hundred yards of the precious
laden sleigh.</p>

<p>Their blood-shot eyes glared fiercely, and their
tongues hung far out of their mouths.</p>

<p>There was no escape&mdash;destruction was certain.
Yes, there was one means of escape, and only
one; that was, to throw one of her children to
the wolves, and while they were satisfying their
hunger on its body, she and the other two might
safely reach their home. Awful thought! She
looked into their cherub faces, kissed by the soft
rays of the silver moon, with that tenderness
which a mother only can feel, and her loving
heart shrank back with horror from such a fiendish
deed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87" id="page_87">87</a></span>
Not a moment was to be lost. The yelling
wolves were within a few steps of the sleigh&mdash;she
felt their heated breath warming her cheek.
One minute more, and herself and children would
be devoured by the bloodthirsty beasts. Love
for her children prevails, she throws herself a
sacrifice to the hungry pack, and soon breathes
her last, surrounded by the growls of devouring
wolves, and the mournful dirge of the mountain
winds.</p>

<p>Children, was not that loving mother the
<span class="smcap">Saviour</span> of her tender offspring?</p>

<p>And now I ask you,&mdash;Will you, can you, reject
that dear Saviour who suffered, and bled, and
died on Calvary, to save you from a never-ending
destruction?</p>

  <div class="line"><span class="smcap">See</span> the leaves around us falling,</div>
  <div class="line indent1">Dry and wither’d to the ground;</div>

</div></div></div>
<div class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Horne.</span></div>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">To</span> me, no season of the year brings with it so
many solemn and instructive reflections as Autumn.
When I look around me and see everything
looking so barren and desolate, I cannot help
feeling sad. The fields which a few months since
looked so gay and beautiful, with their flower-dressed
meadows and waving grain, are now
parched and dead. The busy scythe of the reaper
has laid many a proud stalk level with the
ground, and the frugal husbandman has gathered
his abundant harvest into his garner, or left it
carefully stacked in the field to breast the storms
of the approaching Winter. The variegated
blossoms of the apple-tree have matured, ripened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90">90</a></span>
and fallen to the ground. The garden which, a
short time since, sent forth such delightful fragrance,
now lies barren and bare. The leaves
have fallen one by one from the sturdy oak, and
left it in its lonely barrenness to battle with the
piercing winds and howling tempests of the winter
king. I have sat by my window and seen
the green leaf of Summer first fade into a pale
amber color, grow darker and darker by degrees,
till it finally turned to a beautiful russet, and
then flutter to the ground. When I first noticed
the tree, it was covered with a heavy foliage. In
a few days it became thinner and thinner; in a
few more days a few leaves lingered on its topmost
boughs, and at last they, too, fell to the
ground, and left it perfectly solitary.</p>

<p>Children, can you look upon such scenes as
these, and not feel that they were intended by
God to teach you many important truths? Does
not the barren field remind you of that soul from
which the light of God’s countenance has been
withdrawn? The gathered harvest of that
great harvest of mankind which shall take place
at the judgment day? Does not the oak teach
you, if you wish to encounter the trials and tempests
of the world, that you must lay aside everything,
however small it may seem, which will enable<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91">91</a></span>
those trying tempests better to uproot your
faith and cast you headlong into destruction?
May you, like it, the more violent the storm, the
deeper penetrate the roots of your trust into the
soil Christ Jesus.</p>

<div class="poetry-container67">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">
  <div class="line">“The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose,</div>
  <div class="line"><em>I will not</em>&mdash;<em>I will not</em> desert to his foes;</div>
  <div class="line">That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,</div>
  <div class="line"><em>I’ll never</em>&mdash;no, <em>never</em>&mdash;no, <em>never forsake</em>.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When we look upon the fading leaf and the
withering flower, may we feel that “We all do
fade as a leaf,” and that “All flesh is grass, and
the goodness thereof is as the flower of the field:
the grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the
word of our God shall stand for ever.” How
frequently do we see it the case, that those whom
we consider friends, when the sun of prosperity
shines brightly upon us, cannot be drawn away;
but, like the leaves of the forest, as soon as the
pinching frosts of adversity begin to wither our
hopes and blast our cherished expectations, they
can nowhere be found, but have left us to struggle
against difficulties, when we most needed
their advice and counsel. Let us not, then, put
too much trust in an arm of flesh, but always
rely upon God, who will never desert us or leave
us to the mercy of our enemies. As the leaf falleth<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_92" id="page_92">92</a></span>
to the ground, and moulders into dust, so
does the body of man; but his spirit returneth to
God who gave it, and shall spend an eternity
amid the joys of Heaven or the woes of Hell.</p>

  <div class="line"><span class="smcap">I would</span> not enter on my list of friends</div>
  <div class="line">(Though graced with polished manners and fine sense,</div>
  <div class="line">Yet wanting sensibility,) the man</div>
  <div class="line">Who needlessly sets foot upon a worm.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Cowper’s Task.</span></div>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">About</span> fifty years after the birth of Christ
there lived a Roman Emperor whose name was
Nero. He was one of the most cruel and unmerciful
men whose lives are recorded in history.
He put to death many of the noblest citizens of
Rome upon the very slightest and most unfounded
charges. The most bloody and brutal act of his
life was the persecution of the Christians in and
about the city of Rome. He set fire to the city
in order that he might enjoy the pleasure of seeing
a conflagration similar to that of a great
city which had been destroyed many years before.
To silence the report of his having set fire to the
city, the base Nero laid the guilt of it upon the
new sect of Christians, whose numbers were
rapidly increasing in every part of the empire.
The death of these poor harmless Christians
was aggravated with sport; “for they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_95" id="page_95">95</a></span>
either covered with the skins of wild beasts, and
torn to pieces by devouring dogs, or fastened to
crosses, or wrapped up in combustible garments,
that when the daylight failed they might serve,
like torches, to illuminate the darkness of the
night.”</p>

<p>He not only inflicted upon them every manner
of torture and suffering which his wicked and
depraved mind could invent, but he also took a
great delight in seeing the poor innocent creatures
suffer. Sometimes he drove a chariot
among the sufferers, and at others he stood
among them as a spectator of scenes which would
make the coldest heart melt with sympathy, and
the eye of the most unfeeling shed tears of sorrow.</p>

<p>Such was the character of one of the most
cruel and merciless wretches that ever lived.
And to what thing do you suppose, dear reader,
his cruelty may be attributed? To the great
delight which he took, when a child, in inflicting
pain on the harmless and inoffensive little insect.
It was his delight to extract from it cries of sorrow,
and to tread upon the worm in order that
he might witness its painful writhings. As he
was in childhood, so was he when he became a
man. As in childhood he caught the fly and
pierced its body through with pointed instruments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_96" id="page_96">96</a></span>
so in manhood did he cause his fellow-man
to suffer every pain which his corrupt heart
could wish, or his sinful mind invent.</p>

<p>Whenever I see a little boy or a little girl
catching flies and pulling their legs and wings
off, or piercing their bodies, I always think
<em>there</em> will be a <em>second Nero</em>, if that disposition
is not changed by God, or a check put upon it
by some kind friend.</p>

<p>Children, be kind to every thing around you,
particularly the dumb brute. Do not throw
stones at the harmless little sparrow, or the
pretty little snow-bird. Life is as precious to
them as it is to you. Doubtless they have feelings
of love and tenderness for each other, and
why do you wish to destroy their happiness?
Even if they had ever wronged you, it would be
your duty to return good for evil; and how much
more is it your duty <em>not</em> to <em>injure</em> them, since
they have never harmed you in the least. It
always pains me very much to see a little boy
throwing stones at every cow, horse, or hog that
passes along within striking distance of him. Oh
how unkind! How unlike Him who went about
doing good!</p>

<p>I once saw a boy throw a stone at a beautiful
young horse. He did it thoughtlessly, and did<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_97" id="page_97">97</a></span>
not intend hurting the animal; but the stone
struck it in the eye and destroyed its sight forever.</p>

<p>Dear reader, if you had seen the agony and
heard the screams of suffering which that <em>one</em>
stone caused that harmless horse, I am sure you
would never throw another stone at a bird or
beast as long as you live. The boy, when he
saw the pain which he had caused the innocent
colt, went off and wept most bitterly; and I am
certain, learned a most instructive lesson. Children,</p>

<p class="center">“For we are sojourners, as were all our fathers.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bible.</span></p>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> cars were crowded. In one corner sat
the grey-haired grandfather; by his side, the
gay, thoughtless maiden; farther on, the youthful
aspirant after the world’s honors; and at his
elbow, the stern, thinking business man, intently
engaged in reading the morning’s Prices Current,
thinking only of Profit and Loss, and the rise
and fall of articles for which he trafficked, forgetting,
not the <em>almighty dollar</em>, but his <em>immortal
soul</em>.</p>

<p>We started. On and on the fire-breathing iron
horse drew us along:&mdash;now hurrying around the
sweeping curves; now ascending some steep
acclivity; now rattling through dark, dungeon-like
tunnels; anon speeding with almost lightning
rapidity over the smoothly laid track.</p>

<p>None seemed to fear. All was happiness and
joy. One was thinking of the joyful welcome
that awaited him at his happy home; another<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101">101</a></span>
of the pleasure he expected to meet with from
the friends of his childhood, from whom he had
been separated many a long year; others were
perfectly indifferent&mdash;no trouble to cloud their
brows, no care to harass their hearts&mdash;gazing,
with countenances of delight, on the fair fields
of nature which stretched out before them, the
mirror-like lake, or the cloud-capped mountain
that lifted its proud head far above the bustle
and confusion of the world.</p>

<p>None thought of danger. None thought that
the next moment might find them a mass of
bruised and mangled corpses, or struggling for
life amid the waves of some roaring river. The
engineer was at his post; the conductor would
see that no harm should befall them.</p>

<p>My young friends, as I sat in that crowded
car, many were the thoughts that rose in my
mind. I thought this life was but a railroad;
we the passengers. Some of us are thoughtful
and considerate; many gay and inconsiderate.
The railroad of life has many curves, to avoid
the current of sin, or the pit of destruction;
many a high acclivity of difficulty; many a dark,
lonely tunnel of doubt and uncertainty; many a
deep cut of affliction, from which the light of
God’s countenance seems entirely withdrawn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102">102</a></span>
The route lies along the flower-dressed meadows
of happiness, and through the dark, dismal morasses
of poverty and want. At one moment
all is beauty, loveliness and grandeur; at another,
the clouds of God’s wrath gather thick and
heavy around us. Some of us are journeying to
our heavenly home; others, far from that home,
in search of what the world calls enjoyment,
but, like the apples of Sodom, bitterness and remorse.</p>

<p>My young friends, if Christ be our engineer
and God our conductor, we need fear no evil.
All will be well; our journey safe and pleasant:
and we shall safely reach a glorious home in
Heaven, and there spend an eternity of blissful
happiness in the company of the loved and lost
who have traveled this road, and reached, without
any collision or accident, its termination.</p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">A venerable</span> minister of Christ left his home
one bright, beautiful Sabbath morning, for the
house of God. He was riding a restless, fiery
mountain colt, but had no fears of his ability to
manage him, as he had been raised from early
childhood, as it were, on a horse’s back, and
feared the wildest animal as little as he did a
playful kitten.</p>

<p>He had gone but a short distance on his way,
when the horse, becoming frightened, made a sudden
leap, and threw his rider headlong against
the projecting points of a large rock lying near
the roadside. The rock entered his skull, and
in a few moments that aged father in Israel
breathed his last, with no kind friend near to
whisper words of consolation in his dying ear, or
wipe the sweat of death from his patriarchal
brow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105">105</a></span>
The anxious congregation waited long and impatiently
for the appearance of their much-loved
pastor, but he came not. His spirit had winged
its way to that bright, happy land,</p>

<div class="poetry-container57">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">
  <div class="line outdent">“Where congregations ne’er break up,</div>
  <div class="line">And Sabbaths have no end.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A portion of the congregation determined to
find out the cause of his long, unusual delay, and
accordingly set out along his accustomed road.
After travelling several miles, what was their
surprise and sorrow to find their grey-haired
shepherd, who had so long and so cheerfully led
them “beside the still waters, and through the
green pastures,” who had taken the lambs of the
flock in his bosom, and protected their tender
little feet from the thorns which strew the pathway
of childhood, lying stretched on the cold
ground, a lifeless corpse. Many were the tears
that moistened the noble brow of this man of
God; bitter were the throbbings of stricken
hearts that stood around the body of him who,
Sabbath after Sabbath, had broken to them the
Bread of Life.</p>

<p>There anxiously kneels at the side of her
sainted father a little girl, whom they have failed
to notice. What is she doing there? Come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_106" id="page_106">106</a></span>
gather closely around this scene, children, and
look at one of your number. She heard the clattering
of the horse’s feet as he hurried wildly
from the spot where lay his lifeless corpse; she
hastened quickly towards the church and reached
her father only in time to hear the death-rattle
in his throat, and see his brains all scattered
over the ground. What does she do? She
gathers them up, places them once more in his
skull, and with her little hands endeavors to hold
the shattered fragments together. But it is too
late now. Dear, loving little Mary can’t recall
the spirit of her departed parent back to earth;
and the sorrowing members of that shepherdless
flock bear her away to a home, around whose
bright fireside and at whose morning and evening
altar shall never again be heard the voice
of one whom none knew but to love.</p>

<p>My young friends, I have witnessed and heard
of many touching scenes, but for child-like innocence,
and tender, loving affection, this surpasses
them all.</p>

<p>I now leave you to learn the many lessons of
affection and love this hasty sketch teaches, and
hope you will not throw the book carelessly
aside, and forget all about it; but think if you
love your parents as fatherless little Mary loved
hers.</p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> celebrated Hugh Miller, when a boy, was
in the habit of scaling giddy precipices, either in
search of some peculiar specimen of rock, or some
unknown species of bird.</p>

<p>On one occasion he saw a raven’s nest far above
the ground, snugly fixed on a very high cliff,
which had never been scaled by the foot of man.
From below it was a matter of impossibility to
reach it, for it was more than a hundred feet
above the level of the sea. He therefore determined
to make an attempt from above. Creeping
carefully along, now holding by some protruding
rock, now clinging to some slender
shrub, he at last found himself within six or eight
feet of the desired prize. There he stopped and
hesitated. Beneath, the raging surf roamed and
boiled. One misstep would launch him into
eternity.</p>

<p>His foot was stretched out to take the first step,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_113" id="page_113">113</a></span>
when he observed, as the sun burst suddenly from
behind a cloud, the light glisten on a smooth
surface of chlorite, slippery as glass. He at once
saw the consequences of such an attempt, retraced
his steps, and was, in God’s providence, spared
to exert an influence for good, the extent of
which will never be fully known.</p>

<p>Reader, have you ever attempted to perform
some act which no one else was able to accomplish,
and been on the very brink of destruction,
when the Sun of Righteousness shone on your
pathway and revealed to your darkened understanding
the imminent danger of your position?</p>

<p>Young man, you that are anxious to write
your name high above that of your fellow-man,
beware how you step. The ocean of a never-ending
eternity is roaring beneath you. You,
perhaps, do not see your danger, yet it is there.
If you are seeking only the riches of this world,
which perish with their using, and endeavoring
to do what no one else has done, pray that God
will show you the peril of your position, retrace
your steps, and remember the sad end of him
“who layeth up treasure for himself and is not
rich toward God.” Luke 12: 21.</p>

<p>The sequel to this little sketch is very, very
heart-rending.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114" id="page_114">114</a></span>
Not long after the above occurrence a youth
named Mackay made a similar attempt; paused
even for a longer time; then trusting himself to
the treacherous chlorite, his foot slipped, and he
fell headlong over the precipice. His head
striking violently against a projecting rock, his
brains were scattered over a space of ten or
twelve square yards in extent.</p>

<p>The rock doubtless yet remains&mdash;a lasting
monument of the sinful folly of man.</p>

stone which marks the birthplace of <span class="smcap">George
Washington</span>, or enter that plain cottage in the
slashes of Hanover, or walk the halls of Monticello,
and not feel arising in his bosom feelings
of pleasure and delight? Such feelings are
natural; and I hope, dear reader, you will
ever cherish them for the memory of such men
as Washington, Jefferson, Clay, and the host
of others who have done so much for our common
country. If we love to visit the birthplaces
and homes of men who have preferred death to
bondage, how much greater must be the love
with which we look upon the home of him who<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_117" id="page_117">117</a></span>
suffered and bled and died for the liberty of the
soul from the powerful bondage of sin and Satan&mdash;the
home of Saul of Tarsus, the scholar of
Gamaliel.</p>

<p>That Tarsus was the birthplace of Saul is not
very certain, as no one informs us of the fact;
but one thing is certain, it was there he spent the
hours of his childhood, there he was taught to
reverence God’s Word, and there his tender mind
received those impressions of love to God and
his fellow-man, which followed him throughout
his interesting and eventful life.</p>

<p>Tarsus, at the time of Saul’s residence, was
one of the largest cities in Asia Minor. It was
beautifully situated on the river Cydnus, in the
midst of a most fertile and picturesque valley,
and was the capital of Cilicia. On the one side
a lofty peak of the Taurus mountains lifted its
hoary head, and stood like a sentinel, to watch
over and protect the city which lay in such calm
quietude at its base; on the other lay the lovely
valley of the Cydnus, interspersed with beautiful
groves of palm trees and luxuriant gardens,
through the midst of which the silver stream
wound its way till it was lost in the Mediterranean
sea. Over this plain, happy cottages were
scattered like stars in the blue canopy of heaven.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_118" id="page_118">118</a></span>
Above the city, about a mile distant, were the
falls of the Cydnus, whose sullen roar added no
little to the grandeur of the scenery. Such was
the nature of the country in which the youthful
Saul spent the days of his childhood and youth.
Tarsus, as Saul himself says, was “no mean
city.” It was no less remarkable for the beauty
of its situation, than as a seat of learning and
wide-spread commerce.</p>

<p>There is something about the word Home,
which in itself is pleasant. How delightful is it
to him upon whose locks have fallen the snows
of many winters, and whose brow has been furrowed
by the hand of time, to look back to the
home and friends of his childhood! Every thing
about the old homestead is interesting to him.
Here, surrounded by kind friends and dear relatives,
he spent the happiest hours of his life. Every
spot has some attraction. In one he once
was rescued from danger; in another he used to
indulge in those sportive games which afford so
much pleasure to the young beginner of life’s
journey; beside some murmuring stream he often
strayed, and stole the nimble trout from its crystal
home, or rested his weary limbs beneath the
wide-extending branches of the aged oak which
overhung the gushing spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_119" id="page_119">119</a></span>
Such, doubtless, were the feelings with which
the great “Apostle of the Gentiles,” when his
mind was “burdened with the care of all the
churches,” visited his native city. And now how
changed! An English writer thus describes the
present condition of that once prosperous city:
“It is now a Turkish town, greatly decayed, but
still of some relative importance, and carrying
on a somewhat active commerce. The population
is about 6,000.”&mdash;However the works of
<em>man</em> may have decayed in and around Tarsus,
yet the works of <em>God</em> remain almost unaltered.&mdash;“The
rich harvests of corn still grow luxuriantly
after the rains in spring; the same tents
of goats’ hair are still seen covering the plain in
busy harvest. The same sunset lingers on the
pointed summits. The same shadows gather in
the deep ravines. The water-falls of the Cydnus
still break over the same rocks.”</p>

<p>Who would not like to visit a city once hallowed
by the presence of one of the greatest and
best of men?</p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Though</span> many a long year has passed away
since I mingled in the pleasant enjoyments and
childish sports of my native home, yet I look
back with feelings of the deepest sorrow, and
sincerely wish that I could again spend those
hours which afforded me so much innocent delight.
It is true, that I had a home only for a very few
years, for I had scarcely learned to love my mother
and feel the worth of my father, before the
clods of the valley rumbled over their coffins;
yet those years were the happiest of my life.</p>

<p>It is in the family circle that we are taught so
many lessons of kindness to our fellow-men, and
it is there we are fitted to enter upon the stern<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_122" id="page_122">122</a></span>
realities which await us in the busy world. There,
and there alone, are the seeds of truth and morality
sown by the affectionate hand of an attached
mother; and a loving sister entwines her affections
around the heart of a thoughtless brother,
and frequently keeps him from houses “which are
the way to hell,” and from a drunkard’s grave.</p>

<p>Blot out of existence the thousands of Christian
homes in this land of ours, and you will
destroy the very <em>corner stone</em> of this happy and
prosperous country.</p>

<p>It was around the fireside that such men as
Patrick Henry, Henry Clay and Daniel Webster
first learned those lessons of wisdom and
unwavering devotion to their country.</p>

<p>Well has it been remarked, “There is no place
like home.”</p>

<p>I had rather part with my right hand or my
right eye, than to be deprived of those simple
truths taught me by my sainted mother when I
was scarcely old enough to lisp her name. How
indelibly are they impressed upon my mind! And
those simple prayers which she taught me&mdash;shall
I ever forget them? No, never. They will go
with me to my grave. And when I was sick,
how she watched over me, nursed me, and prayed
for my recovery!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_123" id="page_123">123</a></span>
My home! How thoughts of the loved and
lost arise in my mind at the mere mention of the
name! That dear father, that more than sainted
mother, where are they? Gone, gone forever!</p>

<p>It is customary with many heathen nations,
when any one of their number is thought to be
dying, to place him upon a narrow couch, set by
his side a small portion of bread and water, and
permit him to draw his last breath with no friend
near to whisper words of consolation in his dying
ear, or shed a tear of regret at his departure.</p>

<p>How different in the Christian family! Nothing
can equal the tender care and soothing attention
paid to him whose sand is well nigh run
out. And when he is gone, how fast do tears of
bitterness flow from the eyes of those who loved
and watched over him even in the hour of death!</p>

<p>William Jay, in speaking of domestic happiness,
uses the following beautiful and touching
language: “Oh! what so refreshing, so soothing,
so satisfying, as the quiet joys of home? Yonder
comes the laborer;&mdash;he has borne the burden
and the heat of the day; the descending sun has
released him from his toil, and he is hastening home
to enjoy his repose. Half way down the lane,
by the side of which stands his cottage, his children
run to meet him. One he carries and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124">124</a></span>
he leads. See his toil-worn countenance assume
an air of cheerfulness. His hardships are forgotten&mdash;fatigue
vanishes&mdash;he eats and is satisfied.
Inhabitant of the lowly dwelling! who
can be indifferent to thy comfort? Peace to thy
house!”</p>

<p>But, children, that pleasant home cannot always
be the abode of happiness.</p>

<p>Since sin entered into this world of ours, and
death by sin, man can never be perfectly happy.</p>

<p>Sooner or later some member of that family
will be locked in the cold embrace of Death;
and sadness will follow in the footsteps of joy.
There will be a vacant chair, and a deserted
hearth-stone, ere many more days shall have passed
away. That dwelling in which pleasure and
happiness now reign, shall soon echo with the
sobs and lamentations of those who have parted
with perhaps a father, a mother, a fond sister, or
a loving brother. He who to-day resides in
the costliest mansion, may to-morrow be an inhabitant
of a hovel. That father who to-day bowed
before the family altar, and asked a Heavenly
Father’s blessing upon his children, may be wrapped
in the winding sheet of Death to-morrow.</p>

<p>How important then is it, that we should look
forward to a home in that house not made with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_125" id="page_125">125</a></span>
hands, whose builder and maker is God. There
father and mother, husband and wife, brother and
sister, shall meet to part no more. There shall
be no night there. Pain and anguish, sickness
and sorrow, affliction and disappointment,
shall be feared and felt no more for ever. How
happy the scene! How joyful the meeting of
friends and relations! How delightful will it
be to meet with that father and that mother who
have gone before, and feel that we shall never
be separated again!</p>

<p>Children, if you wish to meet your departed
relations, who have died trusting in Christ, in
Heaven, beware how you trifle away your inch
of time. If you die in your sins, you can never
be with them in that “happy land;” for to a sinner
<em>Heaven</em> would be the worst <em>Hell</em> into which
he could be placed. Then, “Seek the Lord while
he is near, and call upon Him while He may be
found.”</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Lewisburg</span>, Va., July 31st, 1858.</p>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">My Dear Sabbath-School Class</span>:&mdash;I have
been intending to write you a short letter ever
since leaving home, but have been so constantly
engaged that I have not found an opportunity.</p>

<p>A great deal of interest has transpired since
the commencement of my mountain trip, of which
I should like to tell you, but must defer doing so
until we meet, which, if God spares our lives,
will be in a few weeks. I know you would like
very much to leave the hot and dusty streets of
Richmond, and come out and enjoy the pure
mountain air and health-giving water. My own
health has improved very much, and I do most
earnestly pray that it and my life may be precious
in the sight of God, and I may yet ere long
enjoy the greatest of earthly privileges&mdash;preaching
the mystery of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
I have very often thought of and frequently remembered
you at a throne of grace. Oh! you
know not how much pleasure it would afford me
to see you <em>all</em> professors of religion. You know<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_129" id="page_129">129</a></span>
I told you before leaving, if any of you should
<em>perish</em>&mdash;I feel sad to think of such a thing&mdash;I
hoped it would not be my fault, for I had endeavored,
feebly and imperfectly though it was,
to lead your youthful feet in the ways of righteousness&mdash;the
paths of peace.</p>

<p>I feel constrained to urge you once more to
<em>come to Jesus</em>. We may never meet again on
earth, and I do so sincerely desire to meet my
Sabbath-school class in heaven. Suppose <em>one</em> of
you should be missing, which will it be? May
each one of you ask himself the question, “<em>Lord,
is it I?</em>”</p>

<p>And then, my dear young friends, we want
ministers so badly. Where shall we get them?
Do I not hear at least <em>one</em> of you say, “<em>Here am
I; Lord, send me?</em>” Think of that shepherdless
and sorrowing flock, that vacant pulpit, that
newly made grave, in Amelia county! think how
fearlessly and faithfully the lamented <span class="smcap">S. Hamner
Davis</span> stood up for Jesus, and how triumphantly
he died! My dear scholars, will not <em>some</em> of you,
would it be too much to say <em>all</em> of you, dedicate
yourselves to the work of the blessed ministry?
I know it has not a great many earthly attractions,
but there is something cheering in the
thought of living for the benefit of your fellow-men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_130" id="page_130">130</a></span>
I had rather be the humble instrument, in
the hands of God, of saving one soul, than be
worth all the riches or obtain all the honors
which the world can furnish.</p>

<p>May the Lord abundantly bless and preserve
you all, while we are absent from each other, is
the prayer of</p>

<p class="center">“Separate from sinners and unspotted from the world.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bible.</span></p>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">A youth</span> was once unintentionally thrown into
the company of some half dozen young men of
very immoral character. Their language, their
jests, were of the lowest order. Indecent expressions,
vulgar anecdotes, heart-defiling oaths,
characterized their conversation. It was evident
<a name="there" id="there"></a><ins title="Original has their">there</ins> was no thought of God in all their hearts.</p>

<p>He left them and went to his room. It was
time for retiring to rest. He opened his Bible
and attempted to read its sacred pages; but he
could not confine his thoughts. The low, vulgar
anecdotes of that godless party were continually
flitting across his mind. Their hollow mockery
of God still rung in his ear; the thought that
perhaps there was no God, no heaven, no hell,
disturbed his hitherto pleasant evening meditations;
but that kind, friendly voice within, the
lives and death-beds of parents whom he had
loved only to lose, told him too plainly there
was a God above, of tender and forgiving mercy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_132" id="page_132">132</a></span>
there was a heaven of bliss and joy, there was a
lake whose waves of fire and brimstone were
never quiet. He knelt down to pray, and the
profane jests of that God-rejecting company intruded
themselves upon his thoughts; he retired
to rest&mdash;they haunted his slumbers; he awoke in
the morning&mdash;they still lingered in his mind.
Year after year has passed away, but that half
an hour in the company of the profane, the
wicked, still exerts its injurious influence upon
the heart of that young man. It will never leave
him. Wherever he goes, whatever he does, it
will remain in his mind to the last day of his
life. It may be forgotten for a time, but, like the
serpent concealed in a bed of violets, it will
again and again come up to pollute his best and
purest thoughts, to poison his sweetest affections.</p>

<p>My dear young friends, particularly boys,
write this as your motto upon the fly-leaves of
your books&mdash;write it on the walls of your rooms&mdash;write
it in your copy books&mdash;write it on your
hearts&mdash;<span class="smcap">Keep out of bad company.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_133" id="page_133">133</a></span></span></p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Another</span> year, with its fond anticipations and
blasted hopes, its scenes of joy and its seasons of
sorrow, its days of rejoicing and its nights of
weeping, has been laid in the grave of the past.</p>

<p>Many a bounding heart that welcomed us a
year ago, now lies beneath the clods of the valley:
many a cloudless brow which then met our eye,
now meets it no more for ever; many a manly
form which then walked the streets of our city,
now walks the golden streets of the New Jerusalem.
The young man, before whom the future
stretched in scenes of brightness and beauty;
the young lady, whose glowing cheek and brilliant
eye bespoke a long life of joy and happiness;
the father, whose presence cheered and
whose counsel guided his little flock; the mother,
whose yearning heart seemed to throb only for
the dear little one whose cherub arms clung so
lovingly around her neck; the young minister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_135" id="page_135">135</a></span>
whose hopes of wide-spread usefulness gladdened
his lonely hours of toil; the venerable man of
God, whose golden virtues, mingled with his
silver locks, won the love and admiration of all
who knew him;&mdash;these, all of these, have been
laid in the cold and silent grave, during the year
that is past and gone.</p>

<p>Over some of their graves the green grass is
not yet growing, and stricken hearts are now
bleeding for loved ones, with whom we had expected
to walk hand in hand during the year
which has so beautifully dawned upon us.</p>

<p>During the past year we have permitted many
a golden opportunity for doing good to pass
away unimproved; we have failed properly to
use many a precious privilege; and does it not
then become us, to-day, to implore forgiveness
for the past, and unreservedly to dedicate ourselves
and all we have and are, to the service of
our blessed Redeemer?</p>

<p>Let us determine that this year shall be a
year of entire consecration to God’s service;
that our places at the Sabbath-school, in the
house of God, at the Wednesday evening lecture,
at the prayer-meeting, shall be less frequently
vacant than they were during the past year.</p>

<p>That this shall be a year of prayer&mdash;earnest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_136" id="page_136">136</a></span>
importunate prayer. That we will especially
pray for those who are bound to us by ties of
affection and love, but who know nothing of
the warm affection and tender love of a Saviour’s
heart.</p>

<p>That it shall be a year of heart-searching.</p>

<p>“Search me, O God, and know my heart; try
me, and know my thoughts: and see if there be
any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way
everlasting.”</p>

<p>That it shall be a year of unremitting prayer
for the outpouring of God’s spirit, not only upon
the church with which we are connected, but
throughout the length and breadth of His vineyard.</p>

<p>And, in conclusion, that we will endeavor so
to live and act, that whenever the summons comes
to call us hence, our lights shall be burning, our
lamps trimmed, and we shall hear the welcome
invitation, “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit
the kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation of the world.”</p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">There</span> is but one instance mentioned in the
Bible in which a person went to sleep during religious
service. It was at night. Paul, the eloquent
preacher, with his usual burning zeal and
strong enthusiasm, had enchained the attention
of his audience till a late hour&mdash;12 o’clock. On
the morning he was to leave them, His hearers
were hanging with deep sorrow on his parting
words, for they felt “they should see his face
no more.” There was, doubtless, many a <a name="quivering" id="quivering"></a><ins title="Original has quiverering">quivering</ins>
lip, many a tearful eye, many a throbbing
heart.</p>

<p>In the midst of such a scene, beneath the
preaching of so gifted, so talented a man as Saul
of Tarsus, there sat a young man unmoved by the
tears of the listeners, unaffected by the sermon
of the minister. Deep sleep fell heavily upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_139" id="page_139">139</a></span>
his slumbering eye-lids; his dull ear was closed
against the touching appeals of the fervent
speaker.</p>

<p>The house was no doubt crowded; for the
young man was sitting in a window; “and as
Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with
sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and <em>was
taken up dead</em>.” (Acts xx. 19.)</p>

<p class="center">A COVENANTER SKETCH.</p>

  <div class="line"><span class="smcap">O fear</span> not in a world like this,</div>

  <div class="line indent1">To suffer and be strong.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Longfellow.</span></div>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Almost</span> two hundred years ago there lived in
Scotland a girl whose name was <span class="smcap">Margaret
Wilson</span>. She was a covenanter; that is, she
belonged to that noble band of Scotch Christians
who claimed the right of worshiping God according
to the teachings of their own consciences.</p>

<p>About this time a violent persecution was commenced
against these quiet, inoffensive and pious
covenanters. The officer who commanded the
King’s (James II.) forces in Scotland was named
<span class="smcap">Claverhouse</span>. He was a man of violent temper,
and possessed a heart as hard as adamant.
The mere mention of his name would cast a
gloom over many a happy home, and mothers
would clasp their children closer to their bosoms
whenever the news of his approach reached their
ears. He drank in iniquity like water, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_141" id="page_141">141</a></span>
breathed out bitter persecution and death against
God’s servants. The poor covenanters were
driven from their peaceful homes by his troopers,
and forced to seek shelter in the rugged sides of
the mountains. There they were hunted and
shot down like wild beasts of the forest. Homeless,
poor, despised, forsaken of man, day after
day, and night after night, they wandered through
the pathless woods without clothing to protect
or food to nourish them. From many a mountain
top, from many a barren heath, in the silence
of the night, the fervent prayer and the wild
warbling notes of some simple Scotch hymn went
up like incense before the face of Jehovah. It is
true “they were stoned, they were sawn asunder,
were tempted, were slain with the sword; they
wandered about in sheep-skins and goat-skins;
being destitute, afflicted, tormented; they wandered
in deserts and mountains, and in dens and
caves of the earth.” (Acts xi. 37, 38.) They
were imprisoned by hundreds, and hung by scores.
Corpses were seen dangling from trees, and the
atmosphere itself was tainted with death. The
blood-thirsty troopers spared neither age nor
sex. The prattling babe and the hoary head
were alike disregarded.</p>

<p>The severity of the persecution only made<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_142" id="page_142">142</a></span>
them cling more closely to their religion, and a
mighty army of martyrs went up from Scotland
to join the ranks of the great captain of their
salvation&mdash;Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The noble courage with which <span class="smcap">Margaret
Wilson</span> suffered death rather than forsake the
religion of her childhood, has made her name to
be held in lasting remembrance. She was quite
young, but showed a degree of calm composure
and unshaken faith worthy of much riper years.
On being seized by the troopers, she was told
that her life would be spared if she would give
up her religion. This she positively refused to
do, and was sentenced to be drowned. She was
alike unmoved by the fierce countenances of the
brutal soldiery and their horrible threats. Her
heart was fixed. She was as firm as a rock.
Finding her still unyielding, she was taken to a
place where the Solway overflows twice a day,
and securely fastened to a stake fixed in the sand
between high and low water mark. Presently
the tide commenced coming in. At first it
played around her feet; by and by it rose higher
and higher; at last the waves approached within
a few inches of her lips. Still she remained unmoved.
Her unclouded brow looked serene and
happy. Her cheek was pale, but not with fear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_143" id="page_143">143</a></span>
Her thoughts were wandering by the banks of
the river of the Water of Life; she seemed to
be listening to the angelic notes of the heavenly
choir.</p>

<p>“Will you deny now your religion?” demanded
the cruel soldiery.</p>

<p>“No, never; I am Christ’s; let me go,” she
gasped out, her voice choked by the gurgling
water, and the waves closed over her for the last
time.</p>

</div></div></div>

<div class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Longfellow’s Village Blacksmith.</span></div>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">There</span> lives in the city of Richmond, Virginia,
a very venerable and highly respected negro
blacksmith, named Gilbert Hunt. For more
than three-score years he has pursued his humble
calling; and even now, at the advanced age of
seventy-seven years, the merry ring of Gilbert’s
anvil is among the first things that break the
stillness of the morning. His shop is situated on
one of the most <a name="busy" id="busy"></a><ins title="Original has business">busy</ins> streets in the city; and
long before the stores are opened, or the busy
hum of human voices heard, the lively glow of
the blacksmith’s fire and the unceasing blowing
of his bellows, whisper in the ear of many a tardy
young man&mdash;<em>Be diligent in business</em>.</p>

<p>Thus has he lived and labored through the
weary days of many a long year. Though time
has plowed many a deep furrow across his dusky
brow, though his head is covered with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_146" id="page_146">146</a></span>
almond-tree blossoms of age, though those that
look out of the windows are darkened, though
the doors are shut in the streets, though the
silver cord has been worn almost to its last
thread, yet Gilbert Hunt remains still healthy
and robust, retains the cheerfulness of youth, and
seems to feel that his work on earth is far from
being accomplished.</p>

<p>His dark countenance, while in conversation,
is lighted up with a happy smile, and you cannot
help feeling, as you look upon the old and grey-headed
man, what a precious promise that beautiful
old hymn expresses when it says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container67">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">
  <div class="line outdent">“E’en down to old age, all my people shall prove</div>
  <div class="line">My sovereign, eternal, unchangeable love;</div>
  <div class="line"><em>And when hoary hairs shall their temples adorn,</em></div>
  <div class="line"><em>Like lambs, they shall still in my bosom be borne</em>.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The eventful life of this aged blacksmith, together
with his vivid remembrance of bygone
days, renders an hour spent in his company very
pleasant.</p>

<p>’Tis true, his name is unknown both to fortune
and to fame; for but few stop, in this cold world
of ours, to pay the deserved meed of praise to
humble, unpretending merit.</p>

<div class="poetry-container57">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_147" id="page_147">147</a></span>
  <div class="line outdent">“Far from the madd’ning crowd’s ignoble strife,</div>
  <div class="line indent1">His sober wishes never learned to stray&mdash;</div>
  <div class="line">Along the cool sequestered vale of life</div>
  <div class="line indent1">He kept the noiseless tenor of his way.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But to return to our first intention. Gilbert
Hunt was born in the county of King William,
(Va.,) about the year 1780; came to the city of
Richmond when seventeen years of age; learned
the trade of a carriage-maker, at which he worked
for a considerable length of time, and by constant
industry and close economy laid by a sufficient
amount of money to purchase his freedom
of his master. In 1832, he determined to emigrate
to Liberia; and in February of that year,
left Virginia. He remained in Africa eight
months, and having travelled some five hundred
miles into the interior, returned to the coast and
embarked for home. His reception, on arriving
at Richmond, was one which would have done
honor to any conqueror or statesman, so highly
was he respected by the citizens. “When I reached
Richmond,” to use his own language, “the
wharves were crowded with all classes and conditions
of people; I was invited to ride up town
in a very fine carriage, but preferred a plainer
style, and came up in a Jersey wagon, seated on
my trunk.” Since that time, nothing of special<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_148" id="page_148">148</a></span>
interest has transpired in the life of this truly remarkable
man. “Toiling, rejoicing, sorrowing,”
he has followed with unpretending simplicity of
character his accustomed labor. Success seems
not to make him proud, nor failure to discourage
him. He has made a sufficient amount of money
to enable him to spend the evening of his life in
quiet retirement, but his place at his shop is seldom,
if ever, vacant.</p>

<p>For more than half a century he has been a
consistent member of the Baptist Church; thus
teaching us, would we have the needed blessings
of life added to us, we should seek first the kingdom
of God and His righteousness.</p>

<p>The event which invests the name of Gilbert
Hunt with more than ordinary interest, is the
active part which he took at the burning of the
Richmond theatre in 1811.</p>

<p>We add a brief account of this sad occurrence,
as related by Gilbert himself, feeling there are
but few eyes which can read it without moistening
with tears.</p>

<p>“It was the night of Christmas, 1811. I had
just returned from worship at the Baptist church,
and was about sitting down to my supper, when
I was startled by the cry that the Theatre was
on fire. My wife’s mistress called me, and begged<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_149" id="page_149">149</a></span>
me to hasten to the Theatre, and, if possible,
save her only daughter,&mdash;a young lady who had
been teaching me my book every night, and one
whom I loved very much. The wind was quite
high, and the hissing and crackling flames soon
wrapt the entire building in their embrace. The
house was built of wood, and therefore the work
of destruction was very short. When I reached the
building I immediately went to the house of a
colored fiddler, named Gilliat, who lived near
by, and begged him to lend me a bed on which
the poor frightened creatures might fall as they
leaped from the windows. This he positively
refused to do. I then procured a step-ladder and
placed it against the wall of the burning building.
The door was too small to permit the
crowd, pushed forward by the scorching flames,
to get out, and numbers of them were madly
leaping from the windows only to be crushed to
death by the fall. I looked up and saw Dr. &mdash;&mdash;
standing at one of the top windows, and calling
to me to catch the ladies as he handed them
down. I was then young and strong, and the
poor screaming ladies felt as light as feathers.
By this means we got all the ladies out of this
portion of the house. The flames were rapidly
approaching the Doctor. They were beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_150" id="page_150">150</a></span>
to take hold of his clothing, and, O me! I thought
that good man who had saved so many precious
lives, was going to be burned up. He jumped
from the window, and when he touched the
ground I thought he was dead. He could not
move an inch. No one was near that part of the
house, for the wall was tottering like a drunken
man, and I looked to see it every minute crush
the Doctor to death. I heard him scream out,
‘<em>Will nobody save me?</em>’ and at the risk of my
own life, rushed to him and bore him away to a
place of safety. The scene surpassed any thing
I ever saw. The wild shriek of hopeless agony,
the piercing cry, ‘Lord, save, or I perish,’ the
uplifted hands, the earnest prayer for mercy, for
pardon, for salvation. I think I see it now&mdash;all&mdash;all
just as it happened.” And the old negro
stopped to wipe away a tear which was trickling
down his wrinkled cheek.</p>

<p>“The next day I went to the place where I
had seen so much suffering. There lay a heap
of half-burnt bodies&mdash;young and old, rich and
poor, the governor and the little child&mdash;whose
hearts were still fluttering like leaves. I never
found my young mistress, and suppose she perished
with the many others who were present on
that mournful occasion. <em>I thought there would<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_151" id="page_151">151</a></span>
never be any more theatres after that.</em>” The old
man was silent; his tale was told; tear-drops
were standing in his eyes.</p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">It</span> has long been a mystery to us that the Bible
is so little read, so poorly appreciated. A few
hurried snatches in the morning, the shortest psalm
in the evening, to a very great extent constitute
the Bible reading of many who even profess and
call themselves Christians. The prolific press is
daily pouring forth issues of aids to Scripture
reading; the most gifted intellects, both of this
and other lands, are using all their powers to
make the Bible the text-book of the age; but in
vain. There seems to have arisen, in the minds
of many, an insatiable desire for something new,
something stirring, something calculated to arouse
their stupified faculties.</p>

<p>Persons will pore, hour after hour, over the
pages of some trashy novel, while the Bible&mdash;<em>its</em>
pages glittering with golden truths&mdash;its chapters
glowing with a Saviour’s love&mdash;lies unopened for
weeks, yea, months; its clasps blackened by canker&mdash;its
cover thick with dust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_158" id="page_158">158</a></span>
They will nestle in their bosoms the sin-stained
pages of Byron&mdash;not knowing his slime is polluting,
his poison infecting, the purest affections of
their hearts, while a stream of living water is
gushing from this ever full and overflowing fountain
of Truth. In the one are found waters of
Marah; in the other, sweet, soul-inspiring, soul-cheering
streams, whose supply is never wanting,
whose freshness never departs.</p>

<p>You cannot inflict greater punishment on some
persons than force them daily to read a portion
of God’s word. To them it is as a root out of
dry ground, having no form or comeliness. Notwithstanding
this, we find in the Bible every thing
that is attractive and lovely. Viewed as a literary
production, <em>aside from</em> its inspiration, there
is no work, ancient or modern, which is marked
by such variety of style&mdash;such beauty of diction&mdash;such
sublimity of sentiment. Its writers are
taken from all classes and conditions of life&mdash;from
the shepherd boy that watches his father’s
flocks on the grassy hill-sides of Judea, to the
king, the golden magnificence of whose court, and
unerring wisdom, attracted the notice of Arabia’s
queen&mdash;from the humble fisherman who mends
his nets on the shores of “deep Galilee,” to the
talented scholar of the learned Gamaliel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_159" id="page_159">159</a></span>
The rich and the poor, the aged and the young,
the wise and the ignorant, the pastor and his
people, can all discover in its pages something to
suit their respective situations. In fact, from
Genesis to Revelation, it is filled with truths simple
enough for the prattling child&mdash;deep enough
for the profoundest scholar.</p>

<p>What sublime simplicity characterizes the Pentateuch!
what melodious notes fall upon the ear,
like “sweet music from some far-off isle enchanted,”
as the sweet Psalmist of Israel sweeps the
<a name="chords" id="chords"></a><ins title="Original has cords">chords</ins> of his thrilling harp! what rapt, impassioned
eloquence bursts from prophetic souls as
they picture the future glory of Immanuel’s kingdom,

<p>Behold that aged man, as with tottering step,
forgetful of the pressing weight of his many
years, he <em>runs</em> to meet his poor wayward boy,
clasps him to his yearning bosom, falls on his
neck and kisses him.</p>

<p>Stand beside the grave of Lazarus; look at
those loving sisters of Bethany, as with throbbing
hearts and swollen eyes they gather around the
last resting-place of that much-loved and only
brother. Is your heart more unfeeling than the
heart of Him of whom it was said, “Behold how
he loved him?” If not, then moisten his grave
with a tear of sympathy for those heart-stricken
sisters; for it is not unmanly to weep,&mdash;</p>

<p>Let us leave these scenes, so well calculated to
sadden the heart and moisten the eye, and turn
to others of a far different nature.</p>

<p>Look at that stranger standing on Mars Hill.
’Tis true he is not commanding in person; neither
is his speech in itself eloquent; but there is
an electric current which continually passes from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_161" id="page_161">161</a></span>
his soul to his eye, making it to flash with dazzling
brilliancy.</p>

<p>With the deep blue sky as his canopy, and
standing where Socrates once stood, he begins
one of the most highly finished and closely argued
orations on record.</p>

<p>With kindling features and burning ardor, he
enters at once into the mysteries of his subject,&mdash;<em>The
nature of God</em>. What eloquence!</p>

<div class="poetry-container57">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">
  <div class="line">“It wields at will that fierce democracy.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>John Milton has truly remarked: “There are
no songs comparable to the songs of Zion; no
orations equal to those of the prophets; no politics
like those which the Scriptures teach.”</p>

<p>But there is another feature in this precious
Book to which we would briefly direct your attention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Characters.</span>&mdash;A young man, dressed in
the plain garb of a husbandman, is wandering
over the rugged sides of mount Ephraim in search
of his father’s cattle. Exposure to wind and
storm has rendered his frame robust, his tread
firm and steady. Fearless courage sits enthroned
on his peerless brow; stubborn resolution, untiring
energy, prompt decision, all beam from a
countenance, which, though bronzed by the ardent<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_162" id="page_162">162</a></span>
frown of the summer’s sun, yet is none the less
attractive for the noble qualities which it so
plainly displays. But it is the commanding appearance
of his person, the symmetry of his form,
which first unconsciously draws the attention.
As the oak of the forest lifts its head far above
the surrounding trees, so does the dauntless crest
of this choice young man rise head and shoulders
above his companions.</p>

<p>Such is the person and character of him who
was chosen as the first king of Israel; and as
Pallas, “over the head and shoulders broad” of
Ulysses,</p>

<div class="poetry-container57">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">
  <div class="line outdent">“Diffused grace celestial, his whole form</div>

</div></div></div>

<p class="noi1">so God endowed the son of Kish, in order that
he might better command the respect of those
over whom he was called to preside.</p>

<p>Time does not suffice to notice in detail his
anointing by the venerable Samuel, nor the
swelling tide of human beings which rolled along
the streets of Mizpah, on the day of his proclamation,
nor how the enemies of Israel were swept
before his stalwart arm, like chaff before the
whirlwind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_163" id="page_163">163</a></span>
Thus far Saul presents one of the noblest specimens
of filial obedience, of daring bravery, of
unreserved submission to the will of God, to be
found in sacred history.</p>

<p>But his heart becomes elated at his unparalleled
success, and the remainder of his life is a
series of heaven-daring presumption, of flagrant
disobedience, of detestable faithlessness, of unmanly
cowardice; his bosom swells with arrogant
pride&mdash;that invariable precursor of destruction&mdash;which
paves his way to the most ignominious
of deaths&mdash;that of a cowardly suicide.</p>

<p>But only remember that <em>one</em> act of indiscretion

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">There</span> is one other character, noticeable for
none of those traits which mark the life of Saul;
yet of an order to which no one, we think, will
be unwilling to pay deserved tribute,&mdash;which
next claims our attention.</p>

<p>Two men&mdash;the one in the prime of manly vigor,
the other has passed the ordinary limits of human
life&mdash;are standing on the banks of the Jordan.
The one is arrayed in royal garments, the other
in a pastoral garb,&mdash;for during many a long year
has he led his flocks beside the still waters, and
made them to lie down in the green pastures of
Gilead.</p>

<p>The snows of four-score years have fallen softly
upon his head, and his “brow has grown wrinkled
like the brown sea sand from which the tide of
life is ebbing.” The friends of his youth are
<em>asleep with their fathers</em>; the playmates of his
childhood have also been laid in the cold and
silent sepulchres of Nebo or Pisgah. With the
Poet he exclaims,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

  <div class="line outdent">“They are all dead now:</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>To him taste has lost its sweetness; music, its
melody.</p>

<p>David&mdash;for it is he who wears the robes of royalty,&mdash;insists
on his aged friend accompanying
him to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Noble-hearted old Barzillai replies, that he will
go a little way with him beyond Jordan, but adds,
“Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again,
that I may die in mine own city, and be buried in
the grave of my father and my mother.”</p>

<p>How beautiful! how touching! how true to
nature!</p>

<p>The winter of age is not severe enough to wither
the blossoms of youth!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A storm is raging on the sea of Galilee; the
heavens are black with clouds; the moaning of
the billows, as they dash against the sides of the
vessel, falls on the ear with a peculiar loneliness;
the winds are howling fearfully through the rigging;
an occasional flash of lightning, as it darts
athwart the waters, reveals to the eye many a
face pale with fear, and many a form struggling
nobly with the furious elements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_166" id="page_166">166</a></span>
There is on that vessel an old weather-beaten
sailor, whose home is the bosom of the lake.
Hardship and exposure have rendered him perfectly
reckless as to danger. His brow shows no
signs of fear; his noble heart throbs only with
emotions of fearless daring.</p>

<p>A familiar voice is heard above the fury of the
winds, the roar of the waves.</p>

<p>The practiced ear of the sturdy old sailor
quickly catches the sound, recognizes it as his
Master’s voice, and with impetuous zeal and unshaken
confidence, makes an attempt to rush into
his embrace.</p>

<p>Though this Galilean fisherman doubtless possessed
a rough exterior, yet his heart was easily
warmed into expressions of the deepest love, and
quickly melted to tears.</p>

<p>At one time we behold him, with that quick impetuosity
which so peculiarly distinguished him,
cutting off the ear of a high priest’s servant; at
another, going out into retirement, and weeping
with intense bitterness.</p>

<p>In no instance is his ardent temperament more
plainly shown, than the one in which Christ appears
to His disciples by the dim twilight of morning
on the shores of Galilee. It is he who hastily
girds his fisher’s coat about him, casts himself into<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_167" id="page_167">167</a></span>
the sea and swims with longing earnestness to
the shore.</p>

<p>It is true there are some acts in this noble
apostle’s life over which we should like to throw
the mantle of forgetfulness; yet there is much
worthy of admiration and imitation.</p>

<p>No one ever suffered more than he on account
of his errors; no one of the apostles labored
with more self-denying application for his Master’s
cause; and we are sure no one received a
richer reward.</p>

<p>We know not with any degree of certainty
how he died, though tradition informs us that
he was crucified, with his head towards the earth,
thus showing he never forgot, to the last hour of
his life, that one act of denial which caused him
so many bitter tears, such intense anguish of
spirit.</p>

<p>There are many other lovely characters which,
did time permit, we should love to dwell upon.</p>

<p>Let us read God’s word with more diligence
and greater earnestness in the future than we
have in the past: let us lay its sacred truths up
in our hearts, and practice them in our lives.</p>

<p>Oh! let us rejoice, that this lamp does not
shed its light on a chosen few, but that its rays
have penetrated many a land of darkened ignorance<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_168" id="page_168">168</a></span>
and fiendish cruelty, scattering joy and
happiness in habitations where sorrow and misery
once had their abode.</p>

<p>Let us thank God, that leaves from this Tree
of Life have been wafted by propitious breezes
throughout the length and breadth of the world.
They are to be found in the hut of the Esquimaux,
the hovel of the African, the wigwam of the Indian,
in the cottage of the laborer, in the palace
of the lord, floating on the surface of the Ganges,
fringing the borders of the Nile.</p>

<h3><a name="who1" id="who1"></a>“WHO SHALL BE THE GREATEST?”<br />
No. 1.</h3>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">A teacher</span> of great wisdom is seated in the
midst of a class of students, who long have hung
with breathless silence on the wonderful words
which fall from his lips. His class is composed
of persons from nearly all conditions and
callings of life. Some have been nurtured on
the bosom of the deep; some dwelt from early
childhood under the shadows of venerable mountains,
and caught from them true nobility and loftiness
of soul; others, doubtless, spent their days
in the peaceful pursuits of husbandry; while one,
at least, has lived amid the active duties of public
life, demanding, perhaps, with Shylock relentlessness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_170" id="page_170">170</a></span>
the uttermost farthing from the hand of
his debtor.</p>

<p>As they sit at the feet of their instructor, what
diversity of disposition meets our eye. One is
impulsive, ardent, passionate; by his side sits another,
of fervent love, gentle mildness, unshaken
confidence; another is evidently very skeptical&mdash;sometimes
doubting the truthfulness of his own
vision; by his side is one whose heart is as guileless
as that of a little child; while not far off,
is another, of calculating mind and heart, as black
as night with vile hypocrisy.</p>

<p>What is the question which has so deeply absorbed
their thoughts?&mdash;It is one which they
have been discussing by the wayside&mdash;for their
cheeks would burn with shame did they think
their Master suspected such feelings ever throbbed
in their bosoms. It is this:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Who shall be the greatest?</span>” (Mark 9:
34.) That this is still an absorbing thought of
mankind, may be seen from the anxious brow and
hurried step of the merchant, the feeble frame
and the hollow cheek of the student, the brawny
arm and vigorous tread of the laborer; yea, the
skeleton fingers of the lowly seamstress, as she
mingles her very life’s blood with her daily toil,
and sings alike the “Song of the Shirt,” and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_171" id="page_171">171</a></span>
Dirge of the Sewer. Neither is it alone common
to the city of the living; its intrusive front has
even invaded the solemn silence of the city of
the sleeping dead.</p>

<p>Though prattling childhood and hoary-headed
age, the lordly rich and the needy poor, there
dwell side by side, how great is the contrast between
the places of their abode! Over the one
rises the proud monument, on whose cold front
are written in letters of gold the names and
deeds of the dead. The simple rose, with its
blushing purity, planted by the hand of affection,
and watered by the tears of love, sweetly blooms
above the other. In what beautiful numbers has
the poet sung:</p>

commerce. No stone, however heavy, is left unturned;
no task is too burdensome, no difficulty
too great, for the accomplishment of his heart’s

penurious economy, a heart steeled alike against
the cries of want, the claims of his Maker, are
called into requisition for the furtherance of this
one mighty object. Visions of beautiful and
boundless fields&mdash;of coffers overflowing with
gold, of princely mansions, flit across his disordered
imagination during the silent watches of

he has reached the dregs of his existence, when
his body is wasted by disease, weakened by age,
when enfeebled Reason sits tottering on her
throne, how bitter must be his thoughts when they
revert to the hearts he has left all crushed and

then begins fully to realize the fact that he

The heart of some youthful aspirant is fixed
with a burning desire for the gaudy tinsel of distinction,
with which the name of some hero in
life’s battle is clothed. He abandons the cheerful
fireside and genial society of home, and chooses
for himself some arduous profession. Every energy
is bent towards this one great object of
his life. Every faculty of mind and body is rendered
subservient to this “heart’s desire.” Hours
which Nature has allotted to rest, are spent in
unwearied application. He finds himself not
only burning the oil of his midnight lamp, but
the oil of the very lamp of life itself. He soon
finds that the race is not <em>always</em> to the swift, nor
the battle to the strong&mdash;that “there is a Divinity
that shapes our ends, rough hew them as we
may.”</p>

<p>As one competitor after another passes him,
lean-faced Envy whispers words of malice in his

dissatisfaction with the present, remorse for

passes by in order that we may cross, but rather
stem the current and breast its billows. If we
succeed, then success has been gained where it is
always surest and sweetest, in the discharge of
duty. We have sacrificed no principle; we have
stooped to no mean act; our gold is not stained
with the blood of trampled-on innocence; our

their fellow-men, we have abundant testimony.
The names of Howard, of Wilberforce, of McCheyne,
of Henry Martyn, of Hedley Vicars, of
Brainerd Taylor, of Harlan Page, of noble-hearted
Daniel Baker, the pioneer of the cross
in the wilds of Texas, of many others, of whom
the world is not worthy, stand out in the boldest
prominence. Yea, such men are to be seen
around us every day. In the pulpit, at the bar,
in the counting-room of the merchant, in the shop
of the mechanic, at the bedside of the sick and
dying, fearing neither the death-breathing pestilence,
nor the destruction that wasteth at noonday.</p>

<p>Shall it not, then, be ours to follow in their
footsteps? Is there any pleasure so great as
the pleasure of doing good?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_179" id="page_179">179</a></span>
<em>Who shall be the greatest?</em> Not in worldly
honors, but in the measureless wealth of disinterested
kindness, and the unfading honors that
cluster around the Cross of Christ.</p>

and onward career of a youth who, despite the

<p class="center p120">A COLPORTEUR SKETCH.</p>

<div class="poetry-container62">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">
  <div class="line">“<span class="smcap">Is</span> this the place where a princess dwells,</div>
  <div class="line indent1">A favored daughter of the King of kings?</div>
  <div class="line">Within their humble and contracted cells,</div>
  <div class="line indent1">Do heavenly spirits wave their guardian wings?”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Stretched</span> on a bed of painful sickness there
lay a woman in the last stages of consumption.
Pale-faced poverty was an inmate of the hovel
in which she dwelt. The broken panes of glass,
the bare floor, the large cracks in the wall, the
scanty covering, carefully thrown over the bed,
all plainly bespoke the absence of the very necessaries
of life. As I entered the door, my
heart throbbed hurriedly when my eyes caught
the destitution, the misery, the wretchedness,
which surrounded me. Several children, from
six to fourteen years of age, were in the room&mdash;some
of them lying together on the floor, others
seated on the remnant of a chair, while one little
fellow, with matted hair and unwashed face,
scowled at me from behind a door, as if he
thought me an unwelcome visitor. The children
had evidently been long neglected. No voice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_182" id="page_182">182</a></span>
love had often fallen on their ears; no smile of
affection had cheered their loneliness. Their
lives had been made up with scenes of want and
wretchedness. Their minds were like gardens
all overgrown with noxious weeds. But few
seeds of truth had been sown in their little hearts
by the hand of kindness, and their little voices
had never sung the sweet notes of “Happy Day,”
or “The Sabbath-school.”</p>

<p>But let me not forget the quiet sufferer, who,
with such calm composure, has all this time been
lying in unbroken silence. Her days are almost
numbered. Consumption, that fell destroyer of
human hopes, has long been gnawing at her
heart-strings. The cord of life is worn almost
to its last thread. Her hollow cheek, her wasted
form, her sunken, death-glazed eye, all tell me
that the cold, clammy hand of Death is gradually
chilling her life-blood. She breathes with difficulty,
for her lungs are too far gone to perform
their functions. Now and then a hacking cough
seems as if it would rend her frail chest to pieces.
In her feeble hand she holds a fan, with which
she is endeavoring to cool her burning brow. Its
faint fluttering is but the counterpart of the almost
fainter fluttering of life, as it hovers round
her heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_183" id="page_183">183</a></span>
I sat for several moments quietly gazing on
the wan and wasted features of the poor sufferer,
before I could summon the resolution to say a
word. I finally broke the solemn silence which
filled the desolate chamber, by telling her that I
sympathized very deeply with her in the suffering
through which she had to pass.</p>

<p>I then asked her, if God should see fit to call
her away from earth, did she think she was prepared
for so awful a change. She feebly whispered
“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What is then to become of your unprotected
children?”</p>

<p>“God will take care of them.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it right that <em>you</em> should suffer
so much, while others are in the enjoyment of
countless blessings?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly.”</p>

<p>“Shall I read a portion of God’s Word, and
pray with you?”</p>

<p>“If you please, sir.”</p>

<p>She reached her arm under the pillow and
drew forth a Bible. Oh! how precious a thing
it is, in the hour of death, to pillow one’s weary
head on the precious promises of that blessed
Book!</p>

<p>I slowly turned its sacred pages till I reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_184" id="page_184">184</a></span>
the fourteenth chapter of John&mdash;that chapter of
blessed memory, which has soothed the troubled
spirits of so many dying souls&mdash;after reading
which, I knelt at her bedside and united with her
in prayer. When I arose from my knees, her
eyes were melted to tears, and a calm and holy
peace rested on her pale and emaciated face.</p>

<p>Reader, it was a precious season to my own
soul. God grant that the influences of that scene
may never depart from me. My heart was cast
down in humility, in penitence, as I remembered
how often I had rebelled against God’s holy law.
The unbidden tear was quietly trickling down
my own cheek as I left that Bethel&mdash;that house
of God.</p>

<p>Since writing the above, “The Poor Consumptive”
has sweetly fallen asleep in Jesus.</p>

glad tidings of salvation to the hovels of ignorance

to console the friendless widow; for by so doing,
we shall surely gain our reward both in this world

can to dry the tear of sorrow, to gladden the
heart of the laborer in his long hours of lonely
toil; do what we can by precept, by prayer, by
example, by toilsome labor, to win souls to Jesus

saving one soul, than obtain all the riches or receive

<h3><a name="sermon" id="sermon"></a>THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.</h3>

<p class="noi">“<span class="smcap">What</span> a thought! The last opportunity I
shall ever enjoy of making my peace with God;
the last time I shall ever listen to the glad tidings
of salvation; the last time I shall hear
from the sacred desk the earnest entreaty, Come
to Jesus; the last time I shall ever sing the songs
of Zion!”</p>

<p>Such were the thoughts which rushed wildly
through the mind of a young man as his unwilling
feet lingered on the steps of the house of
God. He was leaving that house with a heart
at enmity with his heavenly Father. Again and
again had he put off for a convenient season the
eternal interests of his never-dying soul. Long,
long had Satan pacified his restless conscience
by whispering in his ear that to-morrow would
be time enough. To-morrow after to-morrow
had come and gone, yet he was farther from salvation
than he had ever been.</p>

<p>The minister’s earnest entreaty, a conviction
of the awful eternity which awaited him if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_187" id="page_187">187</a></span>
died in his sins, pressed with burning weight
upon his thoughts. He seemed to be held fast
by some resistless power. “Perhaps it may be
the last night of the season of salvation; God
only knows. I will arise and go to my Father,”
thought he to himself. He sought the minister;
went with him to his study; and there, by the
aid of God’s Spirit, trusts he gave himself to his
Saviour.</p>

<p>Fellow sinner, this may be the last night of the
season of salvation to you. Will you not come to
Jesus? Father and mother, brother and sister,
those that love you tenderly, all join in the entreaty,
<em>Come to Jesus</em>. He is a precious Saviour;
he is a willing Saviour; he is an able Saviour.
Then will you not come and cast your burden of
sin upon him? He has never turned away one
soul. “Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to
the waters, and he that hath no money; come
ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk
without money and without price.”</p>

ground. So severe was the fall, he was unable
to move an inch. Above him stood the tottering
wall, ready to fall and crush him to death. He
looked around him; not a soul was near. From
the depths of his agony, he cried out, “<em>Will nobody

<h3><a name="sabbath" id="sabbath"></a>A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.</h3>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">There</span> is something to me peculiarly pleasant
in a country Sabbath. No rattle of carts, no
bustle of crowds, no hum of voices, disturb the
calm and holy quietude of the hallowed day.
Cattle are quietly grazing on grassy meadows, or
sleeping in the refreshing shade; the irregular
tinkle of the sheep-bell falls sweetly on the ear;
the plough stands motionless in the unfinished
furrow; the little songster trills from some swinging
bough its morning song. The household dog
seems to know it is a day of peaceful rest. His
voice is hushed in silence. The clouds glide
calmly across the heavens; the rays of the Sabbath
sun rest sweetly on the face of nature. A
dreamy, delightful serenity hovers over all the
land. The incense of prayer rises from many a
family altar, and the accents of praise tremble
on many a lip.</p>

<p>Let us go up to the house of God. How different
from our city churches! Perhaps it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_191" id="page_191">191</a></span>
some venerable building whose foundation was
laid by men to whom the faces and forms of a
Samuel Davies, or William Wilson, were familiar;
perhaps remains of the foundation erected for the
protection of God’s people against savage cruelty
still linger around it; perhaps marks of the Indian’s
bullet have not yet been effaced from its
rude stone walls. Let us cross its threshold. No
stained glass softens the rays of light, no cushioned
pew invites you to a seat, no costly pulpit
meets your eye; no beautiful fresco will draw
your attention from the minister or the word of
God. Every thing is as plain, as practical, as
solid, as the men who first worshipped beneath
its roof, but who now sleep beneath the waving
grass of the adjoining cemetery.</p>

<p>One by one the congregation begin to enter
and take their seats. They reverently bow their
heads and seek the aid of God’s Spirit to enable
them rightly to understand and apply the truths
to which they shall listen. Many and varied are
the personages which draw the attention. One
is a venerable elder: time has not dealt gently
with him; his brow is furrowed, his cheek wrinkled,
and he totters feebly to his seat beneath the
weight of many years, and a life of laborious toil.
Though the fires of life are well nigh gone out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_192" id="page_192">192</a></span>
hope burns brightly in his heart, and beams forth
from his eye. The assurance that his Redeemer
liveth, is the rod and staff on which he leans for
support. Another is a young man. His step is
firm, his frame robust. He has not seen the
snows of more than twenty winters. His countenance
wears a thoughtful, solemn air. He is
thinking of God, of heaven, of eternity. He has
not come to the house of God because it is his custom,
to see a friend, or to while away an hour.
His is a nobler object. It is to worship God, to
obtain instruction which shall lead his steps in
the ways of righteousness, the paths of peace.
At his side sits his mother&mdash;“he is the only son
of his mother, and she a widow.”</p>

<p>But another form, of dignified, yet gentle, demeanor,
enters the door. The placid features of
his face, the mildness of his eye, point him out as
“the man of God.” His appearance is such as at
once to attract the attention. He is very tall,
perhaps above six feet. His person is quite
spare. He is slightly bowed with age, and as he
feebly walks down the aisle, you almost involuntarily
rise from your seat as if to do him reverence.
He has long been a laborer in his Master’s
vineyard. For more than half a century
has he proclaimed the glad tidings of salvation<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_193" id="page_193">193</a></span>
from the same pulpit which he now occupies. His
mind easily reverts to the time when the whistle
of the red man’s bullet was liable at any moment
to disturb the worship of God’s people;
when the hardy pioneers of Christ and His kingdom
came up to the house of God with muskets
lashed to their backs. The thriving village in
which he now resides was then almost a wilderness;
cattle grazed, and corn grew in the fertile
valleys from which now rises the populous city.
The wild Alleghanies, then the home of the beasts
of the forest, now daily echo with the rattle of
the stage coach; and the shrill whistle of the locomotive
has made the panther and the bear to
seek shelter in the more distant West. He is
one of a very few of the links which bind the
Virginia of the present with the Virginia of
fifty years ago. His few remaining silver locks
are combed back from a forehead of fine proportions.
He enters the sacred desk; bows his
head and supplicates the assistance of God’s
Spirit. He rises; “Let us worship God,” falls
tremblingly from his lips, and the whole congregation
rise to their feet. With earnestness, with
simplicity, he invokes the presence of Him with
whom is the residue of the Spirit. He then
slowly turns to that beautiful old hymn, so dear
to God’s people&mdash;</p>

  <div class="line">Be my vain wishes stilled;</div>
  <div class="line">And may this consecrated hour</div>
  <div class="line">With better hopes be filled.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi1">So distinct is his enunciation that his voice
falters on every syllable. Every heart trembles
in unison with his, and many an eye is dimmed
with the unbidden tear. From almost the entire
congregation rises up a united song of praise.
One voice after another catches it up, till there
is scarcely one which does not join in the melodious
hymn.</p>

<div class="poetry-container62">

</div></div></div>

<p>“<em>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all
acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world
to save sinners, of whom I am chief</em>,” is announced
as his text.</p>

<p>Such a sermon I never heard before; such an
one I am afraid I shall never hear again. His
voice, at first weak and tremulous, strengthens<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_195" id="page_195">195</a></span>
as he progresses with his subject. His eye burns
with a new lustre; his frame becomes more erect,
his features kindle with animation, as with pathetic
eloquence he dwells on Christ’s mission to
this sin-stained world of ours. And then, his invitation
to those who know Him not. How simple,
how sublime, how earnest! His whole heart
is full of the deepest emotion struggling for utterance.
As he looks anxiously on the waiting
congregation, and in accents of melting tenderness,
says, <em>of whom I am chief!</em> the hot blood
rushes unbidden to my face, and the briny tear
trickles unconsciously down my cheek.</p>

<p>I shall never forget that Sabbath, that sermon,
that minister. They will go with me to my
grave. When I am earnestly engaged in other
pursuits, ever and anon visions of them flit across
my mind, and awaken emotions of the most delightful
nature.</p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Every</span> voice was hushed; every step muffled.
The soft rays of an April sun kissed, with a lingering
affection, the pale cheek of a young lady,
the tide of whose life was fast ebbing away.</p>

<p>She was the child of
<a name="christian" id="christian"></a><ins title="Original has christian">Christian</ins> parents, who
had faithfully endeavored to bring her up in the
nurture and admonition of the Lord. At an
early age she was deprived by death of her
sainted mother; and before many years had
elapsed, she was called to mourn the loss of a
father upon whom every affection of her young
heart was centred. To the <em>bitterness</em> of orphanage
was added the loss of the greatest blessing
on earth&mdash;health. The rose of Death was long
blooming on her cheek, ere her nearest friends
were aware that she was falling a victim to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_197" id="page_197">197</a></span>
flattering and insidious attacks of consumption.</p>

<p>She had not neglected the early instructions
of her pious parents, and, when very young, made
a profession of her faith in Christ. For several
years previous to her last sickness, her mind, at
times, was clouded with doubts, and she occasionally
seemed to suffer unutterable anguish at the
absence of God’s Spirit from the heart. A few
days preceding her death, these doubts and fears
were all entirely removed, and she seemed to enjoy,
to the fullest extent, the light of God’s reconciled
countenance. It was indeed beautiful to
see her, who, but a few weeks before, was so cold
and indifferent, now wholly absorbed in the great
and glorious truth of salvation through Christ.
She was frequently engaged in earnest secret
prayer, and never allowed anything to be read
in her presence but the Bible, or some of those
sweet and touching hymns so soothing to the
troubled heart of the dying Christian. No moment
was to be lost. During the silent watches
of the night, she would frequently call her brother
to her bedside, and say, “T&mdash;&mdash;, read to your
dying sister some of those beautiful passages in
Revelation which our dear father used to love so
tenderly, and caused to be read when dying.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_198" id="page_198">198</a></span>
“How beautiful! how grand! how sublime!”
she would exclaim, when the book was closed.</p>

<p>Reader, come with me and stand beside the
bed of this dear, dying young Christian, and see
how calmly, serenely and happily a Christian
can die. Contrast <em>her</em> death-bed with that of
Hume or Voltaire, and tell me if there is not
something in religion they knew nothing about&mdash;something
that fits a man for <em>life</em>, and especially
for death; listen attentively to the few words
which drop from her faltering tongue; treasure
them in your memory, and so live that your last
end may be like hers.</p>

<p>The devoted Pastor of the &mdash;&mdash; church had
frequent and delightful interviews with her. In
one of them the following conversation occurred:
“Miss M&mdash;&mdash;, you doubtless are aware that you
can be with us but a few days more; are you <em>perfectly</em>
resigned to God’s will?” With calm and
sweet composure, she replied, “Yes, Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;,
perfectly, <em>perfectly</em>, <span class="p70">PERFECTLY</span>; I long to be with
my Saviour; earth has no charms for me now.”</p>

<p>After reading the beautiful 14th chapter of
St. John, Mr. M&mdash;&mdash; extended his hand, and was
about bidding her, what seemed to him, a last
farewell, when she made the following remarks:
“Perhaps this will be the last time we shall ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_199" id="page_199">199</a></span>
meet again on earth: I wish you to preach my funeral
sermon in the old R&mdash;&mdash;n church&mdash;the church
of my father and my mother, where first I listened
to the glad tidings of salvation; preach it from
the text, “In the way of righteousness is life;
and in the pathway thereof there is no death”&mdash;Prov.
xii., 28. Preach to the living&mdash;to the living&mdash;to
the living! And I want the congregation
to sing that delightful hymn, beginning,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">
  <div class="line">‘God moves in a mysterious way&mdash;’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi1">Good-bye.” The Sabbath previous to her death,
several of her friends united in singing that
beautiful old hymn,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">
  <div class="line">“Rock of ages,” &amp;c.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi1">When they had completed the 3d verse, and
were just beginning the last&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container52">

  <div class="line outdent">“While I draw this fleeting breath,</div>
  <div class="line">When my heart-strings break in death,</div>
  <div class="line">When I soar to worlds unknown,</div>
  <div class="line">See Thee on Thy judgment throne,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="line"><em>Rock of Ages, cleft for me,</em></div>
  <div class="line"><em>Let me hide myself in Thee</em>”&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi1">she, with a sweetness and heavenly melody which
beggars description, joined with them and sung
the entire verse <em>alone</em>,&mdash;as the voices of all in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_200" id="page_200">200</a></span>
the room were so much choked with emotion
they could not utter a word. Oh, what a scene!
That feeble, faltering voice spending its “last
lingering breath” in singing her Redeemer’s
praise! I felt as if I was standing in the very
vestibule of heaven, catching some of those
sweet accents of devotion warbled by immortal
tongues. Such composure, confiding trust, holy
resignation!</p>

<p>When her brothers and sister stood around her
bed to receive the dying embrace and last fond
kiss of their dear sister, she made them kneel
down at her side, laid her feeble hands on their
<em>orphan</em> heads, (yea, <em>doubly orphan</em>, since she was
about leaving them,) and gave them a sister’s
dying blessing. She then remarked to her younger
brother:&mdash;“My brother, you <em>alone</em>, of the three
which will be left when I am gone, are not a
Christian. My brother&mdash;my young, fatherless,
motherless, almost sisterless brother&mdash;<em>be a Christian!</em>”</p>

<p>A few moments before her death, a new and
unusual lustre shone forth from her eyes, a beautiful
glow mantled her hitherto pale and wan
check, and in accents of the most touching and
rapt eloquence, her voice rich and full, she gave
utterance to the following sublime sentiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_201" id="page_201">201</a></span>
which should live forever, and be proclaimed
wherever the Gospel of Christ is preached:&mdash;“I
have tasted of Racine; I have dipped into Voltaire;
I have read Tom Paine; I have had the
daring audacity to study Hume; I have attempted
to form a Philosophy myself&mdash;but have found
them all”&mdash;not one exception&mdash;“<span class="p70">FALLACY, FALLACY!</span>”</p>

<p>With these words lingering on her lips, she
calmly and resignedly fell asleep in Jesus. O
for the death of those that die in the Lord!</p>

<p>The devoted Mr. M&mdash;&mdash; complied with her
minutest requests; and when he informed the
congregation that he preached to them from
the text selected by his departed sister in Christ,
and that she urgently requested him to preach
to the <em>living</em>, there was not a dry eye in the
house. Many a soul left that old time-honored
church, feeling that “<span class="smcap">In the way of righteousness
is life; and in the pathway thereof
there is no death</span>.”</p>

<h3><a name="prayer" id="prayer"></a>WHAT PRAYER DOES.</h3>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Prayer</span> moves the arm that moves the world.”</p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Herod</span> Agrippa, finding that the death of the
Apostle James pleases the Jews, has seized the
venerable Galileean fisherman and thrust him
into prison. Four quaternions of soldiers are
guarding him. He is chained by each hand to a
Roman soldier&mdash;soldiers who know that, to sleep
at their post is to die. Thus guarded, the doors
and windows and gates all bolted and barred, he
lays himself down to sleep. His sleep is doubtless
sweet and refreshing. His faith is strong in
the promises of the Lord. To human eyes, death
seems certain. On the coming morrow, this
veteran soldier of the cross must lay his life
down for Jesus. Tears, hot and bitter, will be
shed by God’s people over the lifeless form of
him who once so fearlessly breasted the strong
waves of Galilee to meet his Master.</p>

<p>But we are told that the Church “made prayer
unto <em>God, without ceasing, for him</em>.” And even
while he is quietly and sweetly sleeping, there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_203" id="page_203">203</a></span>
going up from an inner chamber on one of the
dark and unfrequented streets of Jerusalem, a
fervent, importunate prayer in his behalf.</p>

<p>During the prayer, an angel of the Lord descends
and stands by the side of the slumbering
apostle. A heavenly radiance lights up the dark
cells of the dismal prison. The heaven-sent messenger
arouses the sleeper, and the chains fall
from his hands. No sound of footsteps is heard;
no rattle of chains breaks the solemn silence.
There is no hurry. Peter slowly girds his coat
about him, and binds on his sandals. He then
throws his rough cloak around him, and follows
the angel. They pass, unheard and unseen,
through the wards of the prison; the massive
gate moves on its hinges, and opens wide at their
approach. At last he is safe&mdash;safe from the
wrath of his enemies. All&mdash;all of this accomplished
through importunate intercessory prayer!</p>

<p>Christian, I care not how lowly your situation,
never say again, “<em>I can’t do any thing for Jesus.</em>”
<span class="smcap">You can pray.</span></p>

<h3><a name="without" id="without"></a>“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”</h3>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">During</span> a great outpouring of God’s Spirit at
&mdash;&mdash; college, my attention was called to the case
of a young man of the most wicked and immoral
character. It is true, he was the son of a godly
father and a praying mother; but this, rather
than softening, seemed to harden his heart.
It was one of the most copious outpourings of
God’s Spirit I ever witnessed. The windows of
heaven were indeed opened, and God was pouring
out such a blessing that it seemed there could not
be room to contain it. The dry bones of the
valley had been breathed upon by His Spirit, and
hearts once dead in trespasses and sins were
awakened to a new life, and rejoicing in the
blessed hope of salvation through Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Nearly every student seemed to feel the need
of a Saviour. Every countenance was marked
with concern; every heart lifted to God in prayer
for mercy and forgiveness. Rooms which once
resounded with drunken revellings, were now
Bethels of the living God. Lips which once<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_205" id="page_205">205</a></span>
profaned Jehovah’s name, and joined in singing
lewd and vulgar songs, now trembled with the
accents of prayer, and sung the songs of Zion.
It was a delightful season&mdash;I shall never forget it.</p>

<p>Amid such scenes as these, there was one whose
hard heart was steeled against the influence of
God’s awakening Spirit. It was A. M&mdash;&mdash;, the
son of pious parents. Many and fervent were
the prayers which ascended in his behalf, but
they seemingly were of no avail. The more
Christians prayed for him, the more hardened he
became. The campus, time and again, resounded
with his awful profanity; and even the most obdurate
would stop and wonder that man, “whose
breath was in his nostrils,” could call upon God
so frequently and earnestly to <em>damn</em> rather than
<em>save</em> his soul.</p>

<p>Such was the extent to which his God-defying;
wickedness went, that frequently, when the Christian
students were engaged in the exercises of a
prayer-meeting, he gathered together a few of
his sinful comrades and held a <em>mock prayer-meeting</em>
in an adjoining room. Is it not wonderful
that God did not cut him down in the midst of
such heaven-daring presumption? But, like Paul,
he was a chosen vessel. God had yet a great
and glorious work for him to perform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_206" id="page_206">206</a></span>
During one of those meetings which he was in
the habit of holding, the arrow of conviction
pierced his flinty heart, and laid him low and
bleeding at the foot of the cross.</p>

<p>Great was the joy among the students, when
the glad tidings flew from lip to lip that A.
M&mdash;&mdash; had come to Jesus and fallen at His feet.
Old men wept with delight, and yearning hearts
throbbed with inexpressible pleasure.</p>

<p>The “tidings of great joy” soon winged their
way to the ear of the young man’s mother. Her
heart overflowed with rejoicing, and tears of exultation
flowed in quick succession down her furrowed
cheek. Said she to a friend, “<em>I have
never bowed my knee without beseeching God
to convert my poor wayward boy; and now my
prayer is answered. Joy, joy, joy!</em> Now let
thy servant depart in peace. My son is a Christian.”</p>

<p>This wayward boy is now a devoted minister
of Christ, and has gone far hence to proclaim
the glad tidings of salvation to the hundreds of
settlers scattered along our western territories.
Christian fathers, Christian mothers, Christian
brothers, Christian sisters, <em>pray without ceasing</em>
for those who are near and dear to you. Your
prayers will be answered.</p>

<p class="center p120">INSTITUTION FOR THE DEAF, DUMB,
AND BLIND.</p>



<p class="right"><i>Staunton, Va.</i>, May, 1859.</p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> Institution for the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind,
situated at this place, is a building of very attractive
and beautiful appearance. Occupying
an eminence to the right of the Virginia Central
Railroad, it is among the first things that
attract the attention in your approach to this
beautiful mountain town,&mdash;for we believe it has
not yet risen to the dignity of a city.</p>

<p>The style of the building is Doric; the entrance
being a large portico supported by six
massive pillars. On each side of the portico are
two attractive wings, used for the reception of
visitors and recitation rooms;&mdash;in the rear are<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_208" id="page_208">208</a></span>
several other apartments, all large and well
arranged, appropriated to the different purposes
of the Institution.</p>

<p>The building is situated in the midst of quite
a number of stalwart mountain oaks, and the
yard is beautifully diversified by various kinds
of shrubbery and winding graveled walks.
There is an absence of everything like studied
formality in the arrangement of both the shrubbery
and the walks, and the eye is at once struck
with the peculiarly easy and natural appearance
of the building and its surrounding ornaments.</p>

<p>On entering, you are at once pleased with the
neatness and beauty of the internal arrangements.
A very polite and attentive gentleman
meets you in the reception room, and inquires if
you wish to look through the Institution. On
replying affirmatively, you are first ushered into
the apartment for</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="center">THE BLIND.</p>
</div>
<p>The scene is one which awakens mingled feelings
of pleasure and pain; of pleasure to see so
many afflicted little ones, for most of them are
young, led by the hand of kindness in the
pleasant and peaceful ways of wisdom; of pain,
when you behold them rolling wildly their sightless<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_209" id="page_209">209</a></span>
orbs, and seemingly endeavoring to gather
in some few straggling rays of the cheerful sun,
or to look out upon the beautifully draped fields
of nature, and know that all these things, so attractive
to us, are midnight darkness to them.</p>

<p>One of the scholars, a little girl about ten
years old, read several passages from various
books for me, and then pointed out on a large
map of the United States, Pittsburg, and told
me at the junction of what rivers it was situated,
Richmond, Staunton, and many other places, with
an ease and accuracy really astonishing. Two
other girls, somewhat older, sung, and played on
the piano “Do they miss me at home?” As I
listened to the sweet melody of their well-tuned
voices, I, for a moment, forgot their blindness,
and felt tears dimming my eyes as my mind wandered
back to the two near and dear ones at
home, and I thought to myself, “Do they miss
ME at home?” I then listened to the reading of
several passages in French by a young lady of
about sixteen. It really was surprising to witness
the fluency with which her delicate fingers
glided over word after word, and sentence after
sentence.</p>

<p>In all these cases the reading is done by passing
the fingers over raised letters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_210" id="page_210">210</a></span>
The sweetness of expression, the amiability of
character, the flow of spirits which characterized
one of the little pupils, Bettie Archibald, engaged
my attention, and enlisted my affection.
On being asked if she would be blind in heaven,
she very sweetly and quickly replied, “No, sir.”</p>

<p>Quite a number of the male pupils are daily
instructed in instrumental music, and many of
them display more than ordinary talents. It
was quite a treat to hear the little fellows play
“Yankee Doodle:” their faces were soon lighted
up with smiles, and they played with as much
life and animation, as if they were leading an
American army on to victory.</p>

<p>We now wend our way into the apartments
for</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="center">THE DEAF AND DUMB.</p>
</div>
<p>A large class, consisting of boys and girls, is
seated in regular order opposite their instructor,
who is also deaf and dumb. At a given signal,
they all devoutly rise, and with eyes fixed on the
fingers of their teacher, follow him in his devotions,
as he leads them to a throne of grace. It
is the most touching scene I ever witnessed.
There is but one person (he, your correspondent,)
in that large assembly can utter a syllable, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_211" id="page_211">211</a></span>
distinguish a sound. Not a sound is heard; the
stillness becomes painful&mdash;deathlike; the devotion
seems to grow warmer and warmer; the
prayer is concluded; the seats resumed; all of
this gone through without the utterance of <em>one</em>
word.</p>

<p>What a lesson should it teach us! How true
is it that we shall not be heard for our much
speaking! Leaving the chapel, we enter the recitation
room. Each pupil is standing opposite
a black-board, with his eyes turned to the
teacher; questions and answers are written by
the instructor, and then copied by the pupils.
In this room are assembled classes, each under
the charge of a separate teacher, studying
geography, grammar, history; and in one room
is a small class just beginning to read. The
chirography of some of the pupils is really beautiful;
and we leave the room feeling that though
God has deprived them of two senses, yet, in his
loving kindness, he has bestowed upon them unusual
capacities in the others. It may be a fact
worthy of mentioning, that the deaf and dumb
do the printing (raised letters) for the Blind:
such is the economy of the Institute.</p>

<p>The number of pupils in the departments is at
present sixty-nine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_212" id="page_212">212</a></span>
In conclusion, I would express my especial
thanks and obligations to Assistant-principal
Mr. <span class="smcap">Covell</span>, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Coleman</span>, of the Blind, and
Mr. <span class="smcap">Fink</span>, of the Deaf-mute Department, for
their extreme kindness and attention.</p>

<p class="nmb">In my next, I shall give you a sketch of the
Lunatic Asylum, also situated at this place.</p>

<p class="center p120">THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.</p>
</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Staunton, Va.</span>, June, 1859.</p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> sun was hanging low in the west, when
we stood at the gateway of the Staunton Lunatic
Asylum. His rays were gilding with a golden
lustre the hoary summits of the Blue Ridge, as
they printed their bold outlines on the cloudless
evening sky; and as a few beams fell here and
there on the graveled walks, the flower-crowned
terraces, and verdant shrubbery of the beautiful
greensward which stretches forth in front of
the Asylum, we could but thank an ever-gracious
and ever-good Providence, for His inestimable
gift to mankind&mdash;the bright, sparkling, joyous
sunshine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_213" id="page_213">213</a></span>
A moment’s glance at the general appearance
of the buildings convinces the beholder that they
are not as beautiful nor as commanding as those
of the Blind Institute; though much taste is
displayed in the arrangement of the walks, and
selection of many and choice specimens of rare
and beauteous flowers and shrubbery. You
enter the main building, after ascending a flight
of granite steps, through a portico of Ionic architecture,
supported by four graceful pillars. The
first apartment which we enter is the <em>chapel</em>.
On either side of the pulpit are painted in beautiful
gilt letters, the Ten Commandments; in the
opposite end of the room stands a large and
handsome organ; the dome and walls are
beautifully frescoed. The pulpit is occupied
every Sabbath evening by some one of the ministers
of the various evangelical denominations
worshipping in Staunton. All these bespeak
that these poor demented creatures are not forgotten
on the Sabbath; and even where a few
sparks of intellect linger amid the ashes of minds
once proud and noble, it is interesting to see
how those sparks are kindled anew by the light
of religion.</p>

<p>After wending our way through various other
portions of the buildings, and stopping here and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_214" id="page_214">214</a></span>
there to bestow a hasty glance at one and another
rare specimen of curiously carved workmanship,
by some lunatic genius, we find ourselves
gazing through iron bars at a scene which would
cause the most unfeeling heart to shudder with
horror. There are grouped together, in the
narrow confines of four tall brick walls, not less
than a hundred patients in the very worst stages
of lunacy. It seems that the darkest cavern in
the regions of Despair could present no more
heart-rending picture.</p>

<p>The wild glare of the piercing eye, the dishevelled
locks; the meaningless gibberish; the
incoherent babbling; the fiendish ravings that
rent the silent air, together with numberless
other acts which constitute the sum of a poor
maniac’s life, have left an impression on our
mind that will go with us to our grave.</p>

<p>How true are the words of the poet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container67">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">
  <div class="line outdent">“Oh, what a noble mind is here o’erthrown!</div>
  <div class="line">The courtier’s, soldier’s, scholar’s eye, tongue, sword;</div>
  <div class="line">The glass of fashion, and the mould of form,</div>
  <div class="line">The observed of all observers, quite, quite down.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>We willingly leave such scenes, and turn our
ready steps to an observatory which crowns the
main building, and commands one of the loveliest
views we ever witnessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_215" id="page_215">215</a></span>
Let us forget the painful sights we have just
beheld, and drink in the resplendent beauty of
nature as she stands robed in the crimson folds
of evening&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container67">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">
  <div class="line">“For the west yet glimmers with some streaks of day.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Beneath us are the various buildings of the
Asylum, glittering, like burnished gold, in the
rays of the setting sun. To the north rise the
graceful proportions of the Blind Institute,
nestled in its grove of wide-spreading oaks; to
the west are seen the heaven-pointing spires and
beautiful residences of Staunton; to the east is
the graveyard of the asylum, with its plain, upright
marble slabs, marking the spot where
slumber the remains of many a friendless maniac;
to the south is one wide-extended view of sloping
hills, smiling valleys, sunlit streams and snow-white
cottages, dotted over the scene <a name="like" id="like"></a><ins title="Original has liks">like</ins> stars
in the blue canopy of heaven.</p>

<p>Who can look upon such a prospect and not
feel his thoughts turn from nature to nature’s
God?</p>

<div class="poetry-container62">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">
  <div class="line outdent">“All things are calm and fair and passive; earth</div>
  <div class="line">Looks as if lulled upon an angel’s lap,</div>
  <div class="line">Into a breathless, dewy slumber: so still</div>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_216" id="page_216">216</a></span>
The gathering darkness reminds us that we
have trespassed too long on the kindness of the
gentleman who has so cheerfully shown us
through the many apartments of this truly
noble institution, whose object is to ameliorate
the condition of the suffering maniac.</p>

<p>We bid her, her directors and her officers
“God-speed” in their noble enterprise, and
earnestly pray that they may continue “blessing
and being blessed” until the light of reason
shall be shed abroad in the darkened intellect
of every lunatic in our land.</p>

<p>There are many other points which we might
mention; but they are of such a nature as only
to sicken the heart, and we pass them by in
silence, simply remarking that if there be one
crowning blessing for which our hearts should
ever be outgushing in grateful thanks to our
Heavenly Father, it is <span class="smcap">REASON</span>.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
